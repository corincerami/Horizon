<div class="reviewText">I've had the Cuisinart DCC-1200 for about a week now
 I was hesitant to spend so much on a coffee maker but I'm happy to report it's well worth it
 Sure, you can get other brands of coffee makers for under $25 if economy is the most important feature, but I've had those machines and I decided that, this time, a good cup of coffee was most important for me
  This unit makes the best coffee I've had in a home or office machine and better than most coffee I've had in restaurants
<br><br>This coffee tastes smooooooth!  I suspect the charcoal water filter is the reason for that
  I also like the "shower head" design of the water spout
  The water actually runs up a track onto the underside of the lid and is sprinkled over the ground coffee like a rain shower
<br><br>It's an attractive unit but it also looks like a serious coffee maker
  This unit is no toy
  It looks and feels solid
 The carafe has a good solid feel and balance
 The plastic parts (like the plastic carafe lid and handle) feel like good heavyweight plastic and are well molded
 It's not the lightweight crappy plastic that cracks and discolors easily in the cheap coffee makers
<br><br>I like the 5 beeps when the coffee is ready
  Now I can leave the kitchen and go clean or whatever and I don't have to keep running back to see if I can get a cup yet
  I can hear the beeps
  But if I really can't wait and want a cup in mid-brew, I can just remove the pot and pour a cup - you've got a full 30 seconds to reinsert the pot, before you risk an overflowing filter
<br><br>I like the permanent gold-tone filter too
  I always thought paper filters were a pain
 They'd fold over sometimes and there'd be grounds in my coffee
 But you can use paper filters in this machine if you want to
 I just prefer the convenience of the gold-tone filter (top rack machine washable too)
<br><br>It has an indicator light for cleaning -- it says it's "self-cleaning" but really it's just a light telling you when you need to pour in a pot of water/vinegar and run it through to decalcify the unit
  (I never thought to do that with my other units
  Probably another reason my coffee wasn't as good as I wanted it to be
)<br><br>The low-medium-high setting on the hot plate is pretty nice too
  And the auto-shutoff feature is great
  I don't have to worry about forgetting to turn the machine off
<br><br>The instruction booklet is very good and very thorough
 Comes with a parts reordering form too
<br><br>What don't I like about this machine?  It requires maintenance in that you have to change the charcoal filters
 But actually I don't mind since I think they are the reason the coffee tastes so smooth, and they are very easy to change and not expensive [


]<br><br>Also, the area in the top of the machine where you pour in the water is narrow but again this is just a minor inconvenience
  Just have to pour a little carefully
<br><br>So really it's almost all positives with a couple of very minor negatives
  I highly recommend this coffee maker
</div><div class="reviewText">When my Braun FlavorSelect coffee maker unexpectedly stopped working, I had to scramble to find a new machine
 I wanted another Braun, but unfortunately, they seem to have stopped making a 12 cup coffee maker
 So I had to begin an intense search for a machine that had the features I wanted combined with good value
 I finally found it with this Cuisinart model
<br><br>The advantages? For one, it makes excellent and HOT coffee
 The carafe is solidly constructed and fits securely in square body so there's no chance of someone accidentally knocking it loose
 Because the lid fits tightly, the pour is precisely narrow and smooth, with no side leaks even when the pot is full
 The basket fits inside the housing instead of swinging free like so many models which prevents a misalignment between the water and the filter; the conical (Krups/Braun style) basket accepts both paper filters and gold-tone, although I learned the hard way that not all gold filters fit
 The timer is very easy to program, as is the clock
 The carafe warmer can be set at low, medium, or high for the temperature that's right for you
 I found the "high" setting too hot since I drink my coffee black (I like my coffee hot but not scalding!), but those who add a lot of milk might appreciate it
 The brewing is quick and efficient, with the process taking about a minute a cup, maybe less
 The retro/stainless look complements most modern kitchen d&eacute;cors
 There's a 1-4 cup setting to make sure such small amounts stay hot, and you can select how long the warmer remains on
 The pot beeps five times when brewing is complete and just before the warming plate shuts off
 Parts are top rack dishwasher safe
 It comes with a water filter system designed to improve the taste of the brew
<br><br>But the Cuisinart does have disadvantages
 The water reservoir is located on the right side, in the back, which makes it a little challenging for lefties like me to dump the final bit of water inside even though the carafe pours very accurately
 Although I haven't yet missed the opening, I do struggle briefly with those last few drops unless I use my right hand
 The housing is fairly tall, so if your counter space is only under the cabinets, you may not be able to lift the top in its entirety
 (This is when the small rear reservoir becomes a major issue as you have to have room to completely lift the rather large top toward the back
) Clearance required: 7
5" wide by 8
5" deep of counter space with no overhead obstruction to pull out for filling OR 21
5" of overhead space to fully lift top
 Without the top open, the coffee maker measures 7
5"w x 8
5"d x 14
25"h
<br><br>If you have the space for this coffee maker, you'll love it
 I can't attest to how long it will last, but, as it comes with a three year warranty, I'm hoping for a good run
</div><div class="reviewText">After purchasing 3 other coffee makers, the 4th one is the charm!  This coffee maker makes great tasting coffee
  I never knew there was a difference -- it's worth spending a few more dollars on
  It also has all of the features I was looking for such as: adjustable warming plate, 1-4 cup selection, water filter, programmable
  It is a rather tall machine, but certainly not a problem as it fits fine underneathe most cabinets
  Als, the carafe is well-made and has a spout that pours nicely without spilling
  No complaints about this one!</div><div class="reviewText">Two weeks ago, I needed a new coffee maker
  The Krups Aroma Control maker is in all the stores and catalogs, so I bought one in the local mall BEFORE reading the Amazon reviews
  BIG MISTAKE
  Lesson learned - read the reviews - many negative comments
  I used it for 3 days, and readily understood the description (


) of "eye candy" (looks nice, but seems like cheap plastic) and weak coffee (what they describe as a feature - allowing the coffee to steep - is really a euphemism for a poorly designed system that is guaranteed to give you a weak cup of coffee)
  One redeeming feature - the carafe is very nice
<br>Within 2 days of having the Krups, i was on Amazon looking for a replacement coffee maker (a good cup of coffee is critical in the morning!)
  I went out on the risk curve and ordered the new Cuisinart - no reviews yet
  The Cuisinart has a more classic brewing system (water goes through grinds via gravity), yields a delicious cup of HOT coffee, has a variable temperature hot place, and looks and feels solid
  We happen to have stainless steel appliances (refrigerator, freezer, stove), and it matches beautifully
  Best news - excellent coffee!
  I would highly recommend the Cuisinart
</div><div class="reviewText">I've commented on others' reviews, but wanted to get this up there where people can see it readily
  I liked this coffee maker a LOT since I got it just over a year ago
  It has a few little quirks, which you'll read about in other reviews, but made good coffee and I hadn't had any problems with it
  UNTIL last week
  It auto-brewed like normal and my husband had taken his coffee and left the pot with the remaining coffee (2-3 cups worth) for me to drink later
  I came into the kitchen perhaps 20 minutes after the brewing to find the pot BOILING


literally, a HARD, rolling boil, there was a little smoke and the kitchen smelled like burning wires
  I cringe every time I think of what "could" have happened if I hadn't been there!  I removed the pot, unplugged the unit, and poured water into the reservoir in hopes of cooling it down - which worked
<br><br>I was outside the return time for Amazon so I contacted Cuisinart to inquire about the 3-year limited warranty
  They "normally" charge a $10 replacement fee, plus require you to pay to send the old unit back to them
  They were willing to waive the $10 return fee, but I paid $9
95 to send the old one back
  I haven't yet gotten the replacement, but after doing more research, I've decided that I don't feel safe using it
  I've contacted the Consumer Products Safety Commission (1-800-698-2772) and suggest that anyone with a similar problem do so
  I think that this coffee maker should be recalled
<br><br>I'm adding more here in hopes that this review gets refreshed and up to the top again!  In addition, I've commented the following on another's review:<br><br>"I'm one of those who posted in an earlier posting about the fire hazard on this coffeemaker
  I am SHOCKED that it is still being sold!  People - if you are looking at this coffeemaker, I suggest you keep looking
  Yes, it makes great coffee and looks great, as many reviewers have said
  However, please give more weight to the safety issues than the coffee or the looks
  As far as I can tell there have been no injuries from this


but it seems just a matter of time
  If you insist on this coffee maker, don't ever leave it alone on the stay warm setting!"</div><div class="reviewText">Folks,  this is one excellent coffee maker
  I read the comments here and decided to get it even though some had complained of spillage when lifting the lid and also the coffee not being hot enough
  Well I can tell you that when I lift the lid on mine, the water rolls to the back and then drips back into the machine on a nifty little lip attached to the back of the machine
  It appears that Cuisinart has engineered a solution for the complaints of spilled water that some reviewers mention
  Also, the coffee coming out of the carafe of my machine has steam drifting off of it, so it is plenty hot, another complaint that seems to have been remedied
  There were also a couple of complaints about finger prints on the stainless and the small LED clock being hard to read, but let's be for real, all brushed stainless appliances will fingerprint and this is a very stylish coffee maker, not a kitchen clock(that's what your microwave is for! (wink))
  Actually I think the Cuisinart guys intended the clock for autoprogramming functions and made it LED to match the stainless on the machine
  And if you don't like the water filter, you don't have to use it
  It is a nicety and can be readily found if you search the net for "dcc1200 water filter"
<br>Enough defending complaints though
  This machine makes superb coffee
  It has the best carafe I have ever used(it will not spill a drop and it has a built-in plastic rim to keep you from busting it on the sink)
  It comes with a gold metal filter
  Buy it and you will like it
  And if for some strange reason you don't, then take it back
  All jabs aside, this is an outstanding machine in form as well as function, and the people at Cuisinart obviously care what their customers think of their products
  That means alot to me
 How about you???</div><div class="reviewText">I recently decided that it was time to buy a new coffeemaker and wanted the BEST! I did my research thoroughly, online and by word-of-mouth, and decided on Cuisinart's DCC-1200 12-Cup Brew Central Coffeemaker
 This terrific gadget arrived a week ago and I am thrilled with it
<br>I love my coffee and usually make time to have at least one, if not two, 12 oz
 mugs of freshly brewed java before I leave the house in the AM
 Although this is a 12 cup coffeemaker, the settings are geared for a 5 oz
 cup
 So, for those of you who think a 12 cup machine is too much, this factor should be considered
 Coffee is 98% water and if the quality of water used is not good, your final result won't be either
 Cuisinart's DCC-1200 has a charcoal water filter that removes chlorine, calcium, bad tastes and odors
 The self-cleaning feature is terrific and a warning light will flash to notify when calcium buildup is interfering with the machine's functioning mechanism
 Programming for delayed brew time is a snap with the LCD digital clock
 One of the features I like best is the heater plate control knob
 I like my coffee steaming hot - and this feature assures that I can control the temperature of the nonstick heating plate
 The machine also looks great on my kitchen counter
<br>I had thought about buying a combination coffeemaker/coffee grinder and decided against it
 Apparently, many combination machines leave a sludgy residue and are a hassle to clean
 I preferred using my own grinder, which is easy to clean, and this coffee maker - also very easy to clean and maintain
 This machine is a coffee lover's dream!!<br>I bought the BEST! Very highly recommended!!<br>JANA</div><div class="reviewText">First I'd like to say that these review sites really kill me
  Invariably, you have to wade through countless trivial comments like, "I had to turn the spool wheel too many times before I could change the string on my string trimmer" or, here's a classic, "the stereo I bought is just too loud and I have to keep the volume at the number 5 setting all the time
"  (trust me, this is from an actual review)
  Well, you'll be happy to know that the reviews for the DCC-1200 are no different
  Anywhere from "why do you have to turn the knob to brew and then flick a switch for on" to, "I can hear the plastic creaking as it heats up" (that one really makes me laugh) to, "it's just too tall and doesn't fit under my cabinets" (didn't you size it up before you bought it)?<br>Look people, this unit makes coffee
  It does it well and it does it like it's supposed to
  You pour water in the top, add your favorite beans, wait a bit and, here's the kicker, coffee comes out the bottom!  Holy smokes!  It's got two knobs, an on and off switch and a few buttons to set things like the clock
  To brew, turn the knob to brew and flick the on switch
  To auto-brew, turn the knob to auto-brew and flick the on switch
  To program the clock/auto on/auto off, turn the knob to clock/auto on/auto off and


 press a button
  Wow, this is really tough stuff
  And, to make matters worse, omygosh, the LCD clock doesn't have a back light!!  Armageddon here we come
  You don't have enough clocks in your kitchen between the wall, the microwave, the oven, and every other stinking thing that has to tell you the time these days?<br>The other knob adjusts the hot plate setting
  Low-Med-High
  Trust me, there are many complaints that the Cuisinart doesn't get their coffee hot enough
  Not hot enough?  How hot do you really want it?  I'm sure Cuisinart wasn't thinking about their specs reaching boiling temperature when they designed this thing
  Trust me folks, it's close enough
  I'd say close to McDonald's scalding hot coffee but I won't even sue Cuisinart for potentially burning my crotch
<br>As for the plastic creaking, when the temperature heats up, the plastic expands inside, what do you want anyway?  Whatddya mean it's only stainless steel on the outside?  I've been ripped off!!!  I mean come on, if you really want a true stainless steel coffee maker, go spend the $2000 and buy professional so that you can mount it on the dash of your Beemer
  Just don't waste our time with comments like this
<br>Oh yeah and the alarm/beeping that everyone's complaining about?  Well, let me just say that the "Hounds of the Baskervilles" comment is a little unjustified
  I would hate to hear what this person does when their microwave goes off, or, if their telephone rings, or if one of the kids makes a noise
  Folks, this is a series of 5 small beeps when the brewing cycle is near completion
  Kind of a tee tee tee tee tee
  So, unless you sleep with your coffee maker on your night stand, I wouldn't worry so much about this one
<br>Condensation
  I don't know one coffee maker out there that when you open the lid to dump your grounds just after the brewing is complete where some of it doesn't drip on the countertop
  So, suck it up
  Get your sink sponge and wipe it up
  Are we that inconvenienced by this?<br>And finally, the dreaded reservoir comment
  "It's too small and I pour water all over the place
" Blah blah
  Pour water in, get coffee out
  So far, I haven't missed the bullseye
  Could I be doing something wrong here?  And about those darned tank markers
  Does anybody honestly use those things?  Fill up the pot and pour it in
  Now you know how much coffee you'll make
  Huh?!<br>The bottom line is that this is a good coffee maker
  It has a self cleaning cycle to tell you when to decalcify, makes piping hot coffee but


 oh no, produces condensation
  It's kind of like when you heat water on the stove and it produces that steamy stuff, and it forms those


 water droplets
  Ah whatever
<br>Look, if you're the type who doesn't have to have their maid do everything for them or worse flog the person who doesn't quite fold the towel right on the towel bar, go out and buy this product, you won't be disappointed
</div><div class="reviewText">OK, I admit it, I bought this machine because I thought it looked terrific, cool design, heavy duty manufacture, and I was fond of the retro-chic of the dials and switches, like an airplane dashboard from thirty years ago
  The machine, however, has several design flaws that have greatly mitigated my warm feelings
<br><br>For one thing, the water reservoir into which you pour the water is located in the very back of the machine, next to the hinge for the lid
  It is awkward to use, the opening is too small, and your water often either splashes out of the back or into the coffee grounds
<br><br>Second, the hot water comes out of the lid and onto the grounds, but when closed, the lid is too close to the grounds and gets a lot of backsplash
  The grounds end up adhered to the lid which must be wiped off every time you use it or it will clog
  But when you wipe it actually pushes the grounds into the spray head
  Also, if you fill the (too small) gold filter while it is seated in the machine you are very likely to get grounds into the water reservoir which then necessitates a difficult cleaning of the entire works
  And I suspect that even if you fill it and then place it in the machine, the grounds sometimes get splashed into the reservoir during the brewing process
<br><br>The gold filter that fits this machine is too small
  We like our coffee strong and if you put in enough coffee for a whole 12 cup pot, it expands into the works and again clogs everything making you have to clean it
<br><br>Lastly, within about two weeks of our purchasing the machine, the little thingy at the bottom of the filter holder fell out (it is held in by a rubber band) and now we can no longer pull the pot out in the middle of the brew cycle (a convenient feature for those of us who are impatient and/or in a hurry) but must wait until the whole pot is made to get that first cup
<br><br>In sum, a beautiful and indeed heavy duty machine, but quite flawed
  I liked our old Braun maker much better
</div><div class="reviewText">Just brewed my 1st cup of coffee with the Brew Central DCC-1200
<br>Before my purchase through Amazon I read all 58 reviews of this product and was concerned about the 50-50 division of opinion on the quality of the brew, whether it was hot enough (I need it hot), and the water mess on the counter when the cover was raised
  I should add that I recently purchased and returned a Krups (great coffee but a clunker for endurance--froze up twice after a few months operation) and Capresso (dull, undrinkable coffee)
<br>My empiracle assessment of the DCC-1200 is that:<br>1
 The brew is superior;<br>2
 It is hot--can't see how it could be hotter;<br>3
 A plastic lip connected to the reservoir cover on the back of the machine catches any condensation runoff when the cover is raised
