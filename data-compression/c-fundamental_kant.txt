FUNDAMENTAL PRINCIPLES OF THE METAPHYSIC OF MORALS

PREFACE

Ancient Greek *26* was *633* into three *264*s: *226*, *229*, and logic. This *342* is *330*ly *619* to the *5* of the thing; and the only *615* that can be made in it is to add the *1* on which it is based, so that we may both *612* *58* of its *243*ness, and also be able to *85* *426*ly the *30* sub*342*s.

All *2* *52* is *120* *329* or *200*: the *55* *255*s some *36*, the *45* is *316*ed only with the form of the *39* and of the *0* *3*, and with the *7* laws of *94*t in *47* *13* *239*ion of its *36*s. Formal *26* is *43* logic. Material *26*, *21*, has to do with *601* *36*s and the laws to which they are *20*, is again *599*; for these laws are *120* laws of *5* or of *14*. The *264* of the *55* is *226*, that of the *45*, *229*; they are also *43* *81* *26* and moral *26* *27*ively.

Logic *10* have any *41* part; that is, a part in which the *7* and *30* laws of *94*t *8* rest on *216* taken from *38*; *106* it would not be logic, i.e., a canon for the *39* or the *0*, valid for all *94*t, and *127* of *1940*. Natural and moral *26*, on the *88*, can each have their *41* part, since the *55* has to *85* the laws of *5* as an *36* of *38*; the *45* the laws of the human will, so far as it is *192* by *5*: the *55*, *21*, being laws *62* to which *77* does *259*; the *45*, laws *62* to which *77* ought to *259*. Ethics, *21*, must also *255* the *34*s under which what ought to *259* *1055*ly does not.

We may call all *26* *41*, so far as it is based on *216* of *38*: on the other band, that which *1931* its *640* from a *42* *1*s alone we may call pure *26*. When the *45* is *24* *200* it is logic; if it is re*258*ed to *178* *36*s of the *39* it is *60*.

In this way there *268* the idea of a *599* *60*- a *60* of *5* and a *60* of *57*. Physics will thus have an *41* and also a *2* part. It is the same with Ethics; but here the *41* part might have the *187* name of *4* *324*, the name *19* being *1875*d to the *2* part.

All *646*, arts, and *1918* have *442* by *342* of *384*, *46*, when, *391* of one man doing *77*, each *1913* *9* to a *67* kind of work *239* from *56* in the *585* it *210*, so as to be able to *583* it with *322* *1904* and in the *197* *159*. Where the *103* kinds of work are not *158* and *633*, where *232* is a jack-of-all-*646*, there *1898* *392* still in the *197* *1896*. It might *579* to be *231* *25* pure *26* in all its parts does not *285* a man *187*ly *1668*d to it, and *25* it would not be *173* for the whole *1888* of *264* if those who, to *1887* the *1886* of the *576*, are wont to blend the *2* and *41* *588*s *397*, mixed in all sorts of *1246*s *651* to *50*, and who call *50* *163* *1878*, *154* the name of *1876* *476*s to those who apply *50* to the *2* part only- if these, I say, were *1874* not to carry on two *385*s *397* which *653* *1871* in the *585* they *654*, for each of which *143* a *187* *655* is *285*d, and the *1866* of which in one *141* only *203*s *1863*. But I only ask here *25* the *5* of *264* does not *285* that we *8* *40* *571* *422* the *41* from the *2* part, and *1859* to Physics *139* (or *41* *226*) a *60* of *5*, and to *4* *324* a *60* of *57*, which must be *571* *658* of *77* *41*, so that we may know how much can be *659* by pure *0* in both cases, and from what *219*s it draws this its a *42* *569*, and that *25* the *45* *317* is *129*ed by all *660* (whose name is *1850*), or only by some who feel a *1849* *411*.

As my *316* here is with moral *26*, I limit the *72* *662* to this: Whether it is not of the *663* *28* to *1842* a pure thing which is only *41* and which *133* to *324*? for that such a *26* must be *11* is *665* from the *54* idea of duty and of the moral laws. Everyone must admit that if a law is to have moral force, i.e., to be the basis of an *116*, it must carry with it *117* *28*; that, for *164*, the *177*, "Thou shalt not lie," is not valid for men alone, as if other *2* *22* had no need to *1832* it; and so with all the other moral laws *121* so *43*; that, *16*, the basis of *116* must not be *564* in the *5* of man, or in the *315* in the world in which he is *562*, but a *42* *74* in the *18* of pure *0*; and *31* any other *177* which is *314* on *1*s of mere *38* may be in *67* *27*s *7*, yet in as far as it rests even in the least *211* on an *41* basis, *143* only as to a *165*, such a *177*, while it may be a *4* rule, can never be *43* a moral law.

Thus not only are moral laws with their *1*s *444*ly *158* from every other kind of *4* *52* in which there is *75* *41*, but all moral *26* rests *83* on its pure part. When *312* to man, it does not *401* the least thing from the *52* of man *9* (*324*), but gives laws a *42* to him as a *2* being. No doubt these laws *285* a *89* *1813* by *38*, in order on the one hand to *272* in what cases they are *668*, and on the other to *669* for them *1809* to the will of the man and *64*ual *95* on *129*; since man is acted on by so many *33*s that, *94* *127* of the idea of a *4* pure *0*, he is not so *217* able to make it *64*ive in *1801* in his life.

A *60* of *57* is *16* *672* *30*, not *24* for *99* *0*s, in order to *674* the *219*s of the *4* *1*s which are to be found a *42* in our *0*, but also *23* *57* *50* are *1795* to all sorts of *535*, as long as we are *13* that clue and *63* canon by which to *1792* them *426*ly. For in order that an *6* *8* be *381* good, it is not *184* that it *183* to the moral law, but it must also be done for the sake of the law, *106* that *183*ity is only very *181* and un*67*; since a *1* which is not moral, *31* it may now and then *203* *6*s *183*able to the law, will also often *203* *6*s which *224* it. Now it is only a pure *26* that we can look for the moral law in its *309* and *371*ness (and, in a *4* *171*, this is of the *663* *221*): we must, *16*, begin with pure *26* (*60*), and *13* it there *10* be any moral *26* at all. That which *1776* these pure *1*s with the *41* does not *579* the name of *26* (for what *272*es *26* from *54* *2* *52* is that it *525* in *422* *264*s what the *45* only *451*s *1772*); much less does it *579* that of moral *26*, since by this *683* it even *1770* the *309* of *57* *50*, and *1769* its own end.

Let it not be *94*t, *21*, that what is here *654*ed is *145* *1766* in the *1765* *1764* by the *1763* Wolf to his moral *26*, *46*, his so-*43* *47* *4* *26*, and that, *16*, we have not to *1762* into an *375* new field. Just *23* it was to be a *47* *4* *26*, it has not taken into *255*ation a will of any *122* kind- say one which *8* be *85*d *490* from a *42* *1*s *13* any *41* *165*s, and which we might call a pure will, but *80* in *47*, with all the *6*s and *34*s which *234* to it in this *47* *692*. By this it is *158* from a *60* of *57*, just as *47* logic, which *525* of the acts and *693* of *94*t in *47*, is *158* from *1751* *26*, which *525* of the *122* acts and *693* of pure *94*t, i.e., that whose *596*s are *278* a *42*. For the *60* of *57* has to *699* the idea and the *1*s of a *11* pure will, and not the acts and *34*s of human *80* *47*ly, which for the most part are drawn from *701*. It is true that moral laws and duty are *1745* of in the *47* moral *26* (*88* *73* to all *518*). But this is no *36*ion, for in this *27* also the *886*s of that *264* *392* true to their idea of it; they do not *272* the *165*s which are *456* as such by *0* alone *278* a *42*, and which are *121* moral, from the *41* *165*s which the *39* *1738* to *47* *18*s *24* by *514* of *38*s; but, *13* *1734* the *301* of their *219*s, and *511* on them all as *1731*, they *255* only their *322* or less *708*. It is in this way they frame their *82* of *116*, which, *94* *75* but moral, is all that can be *252* in a *26* which *1727* no *89* at all on the *458* of all *11* *4* *195*s, *25* they are a *42*, or only a *711*.

Intending to *1722* *462* a *60* of *57*, I issue in the first *464* these *289* *1*s. Indeed there is *121* no other *170* for it than the *254* *199* of a pure *4* Reason; just as that of *60*s is the *254* *199* of the pure *99* *0*, *145* *1715*. But in the first place the *55* is not so *79* *30* as the *45*, *23* in moral *316*s human *0* can *217* be *249* to a high *211* of *426*ness and *243*ness, even in the *54*est *39*, while on the *88* in its *497* but pure use it is *83* *932*al; and in the *119* place if the *520* of a pure *4* *0* is to be *243*, it must be *11* at the same time to show its *1704* with the *99* *0* in a *54* *1*, for it can *714* be only one and the same *0* which has to be *158* *24* in its *487*. I could not, *21*, bring it to such *243*ness here, *13* *1701* *255*ations of a *83* *103* kind, which would be *1108*ing to the *1698*. On this *124* I have *337* the title of Funda*1505* Principles of the Meta*1223* of Morals *391* of that of a Critical Examination of the pure *4* *0*.

But in the third place, since a *60* of *57*, in spite of the *1695* title, is yet *127* of being *152*ed in *204* form, and one *298* to the *54* *39*, I find it *283* to *422* from it this *1690* *721* on its *289* *1*s, in order that I may not *462* have need to *1688* these *69* *498* *1685* into a book of a more *722* *284*.

The *152* *721* is, *21*, *44* more than the *724* and *475* of the *63* *1* of *19*, and this alone *208* a study *243* in *3* and one which ought to be kept apart from every other moral *724*. No doubt my *1677* on this *1676* *72*, which has *501* been very un*1025* *699*d, would *728* much light from the *487* of the same *1* to the whole *123*, and would be *729* *730* by the *731* which it *732* *182*out; but I must *1665* this *186*, which *73* would be after all more *1663* than *283*, since the easy applic*1456* of a *1* and its *503* *731* give no very *67* proof of its *505*, but *140* *733* a *67* *1657*, which pr*792* us from *1655* and *509* it *258*ly in *3* and *13* *66* to *221*s.

I have *337* in this work the *449* which I think most *619*, *734* *327*ly from *54* *52* to the *155* of its *735* *1*, and again *736* *307*ally from the *199* of this *1* and its *219*s to the *54* *52* in which we find it *380*. The *342* will, *16*, be as *114*:

2 SECOND SECTION. Transition from *204* moral *26* to the *60* of *57*.

SEC_1

FIRST SECTION

TRANSITION FROM THE COMMON RATIONAL KNOWLEDGE

OF MORALITY TO THE PHILOSOPHICAL

Nothing can *213* be *76*d in the world, or even out of it, which can be *43* good, *13* *543*, *214* a good will. Intelligence, wit, *89*, and the other *434* of the mind, *21* they may be named, or *1632*, re*546*, *1630*, as *433* of *544*, are *431* good and *1626* in many *27*s; but these gifts of *5* may also *126* *561*ly bad and *1623* if the will which is to make use of them, and which, *16*, *208* what is *43* *284*, is not good. It is the same with the gifts of *740*. Power, *741*, *545*, even *400*, and the *47* well-being and *469*ment with one's *34* which is *43* *32*, *733* pride, and often *743*, if there is not a good will to *426* the *95* of these on the mind, and with this also to *1613* the whole *1* of *96* and adapt it to its end. The sight of a being who is not *1611* with a *290* *1609* of a pure and good will, *1608* *1607* *550*, can never give *251* to an *745* *2* *1603*. Thus a good will *423* to *402* the *418* *34* even of being *271* of *32*.

There are even some *433* which are of *1598* to this good will *3* and may *1597* its *6*, yet which have no *218* un*34*al value, but *40* pre*201* a good will, and this *749* the *417* that we *1591* have for them and does not *1590* us to *66* them as *79* good. Moderation in the *506*ions and *1587*, self-*1586*, and calm *1585* are not only good in many *27*s, but even seem to *402* part of the *218* worth of the *141*; but they are far from de*582* to be *43* good *13* *543*, *31* they have been so un*34*ally p*826* by the *1581*. For *13* the *1*s of a good will, they may *126* *561*ly bad, and the *1580* of a *753* not only makes him far more *1175*ous, but also *247*ly makes him more *1576* in our eyes than he would have been *13* it.

A good will is good not *23* of what it *559* or *64*s, not by its *1573* for the *253*ment of some *565* end, but *74* by *202* of the *80*; that is, it is good in *3*, and *231* by *3* is to be *408* much *570* than all that can be *249* about by it in *228* of any *33*, nay even of the sum total of all *33*s. Even if it *8* *259* that, owing to *187* dis*228* of *740*, or the *1564* *1563* of a step-*1562* *5*, this will *8* *83* lack power to *1561* its *49*, if with its *197* *755* it *8* yet *1558* *44*, and there *8* *392* only the good will (not, to be sure, a mere wish, but the *1557* of all means in our power), then, like a jewel, it would still shine by its own light, as a thing which has its whole value in *3*. Its *283*ness or *1555* can n*120* add nor take away *75* from this value. It would be, as it were, only the *1553* to *428* us to *1551* it the more *1103*ly in *54* *756*, or to *1548* to it the *429* of those who are not yet *757*, but not to *1545* it to true *757*, or to *85* its value.

There is, *21*, *53* so *1543* in this idea of the *117* value of the mere will, in which no *124* is taken of its *759*, that *395* the *761* *763* of even *54* *0* to the idea, yet a *767* must arise that it may *143* *156* be the *768* of mere high-flown fancy, and that we may have *1535* the *49* of *5* in *515*ing *0* as the *1533* of our will. Therefore we will *699* this idea from this point of view.

In the *125* *225* of an *1530* being, that is, a being *298* *769* to the *49*s of life, we *172* it as a *289* *1* that no organ for any *49* will be found but what is also the *1526* and best *298* for that *49*. Now in a being which has *0* and a will, if the *139* *36* of *5* were its *1525*, its *300*, in a word, its *32*, then *5* would have hit upon a very bad *1523* in *1522* the *0* of the *386* to carry out this *49*. For all the *6*s which the *386* has to *583* with a view to this *49*, and the whole rule of its *129*, would be far more *1520* *456* to it by *302*, and that end would have been *252* *112* much more *67*ly than it ever can be by *0*. Should *0* have been *1516* to this *228*ed *386* over and above, it must only have *772* it to *773* the happy *225* of its *5*, to *1512* it, to *1511* *3* *1510*, and to feel *1509* for it to the *594* cause, but not that it *8* *20* its *100* to that weak and *1506* *774* and *1504* *1503* with the *49* of *5*. In a word, *5* would have taken care that *0* *8* not break forth into *4* *406*, nor have the *743*, with its weak *453*, to think out for *3* the plan of *32*, and of the means of *253*ing it. Nature would not only have taken on *1499* the *365* of the ends, but also of the means, and with wise *1497* would have *1496* both to *302*.

And, in fact, we find that the more a *1495* *0* *1494* *3* with *1493* *49* to the *610* of life and *32*, so much the more does the man fail of true satisf*6*. And from this *1490* there *268* in many, if they are *1489* *184* to *1488* it, a *67* *211* of *1487*, that is, *1486* of *0*, e*187*ly in the case of those who are most *38*d in the use of it, *23* after *1483* all the *186*s they *468*, I do not say from the *1480* of all the arts of *54* *776*, but even from the *264*s (which seem to them to be after all only a *776* of the *39*), they find that they have, in fact, only *249* more *777* on their *8*ers, *140* than *442* in *32*; and they end by *1476*, *140* than *1475*, the more *54* stamp of men who keep *779* to the *774* of mere *302* and do not allow their *0* much *95* on their *129*. And this we must admit, that the *89* of those who would very much lower the lofty *1473* of the *186*s which *0* gives us in *66* to the *32* and satisf*6* of life, or who would even *354* them below zero, is by no means *1471* or *1470* to the *780* with which the world is *1468*, but that there lies at the root of these *89*s the idea that our *206* has a *103* and far *1465* end, for which, and not for *32*, *0* is *121* *472*, and which must, *16*, be *66*ed as the *63* *34* to which the *325* ends of man must, for the most part, be *474*.

For as *0* is not *1460* to guide the will with *67*ty in *66* to its *36*s and the satisf*6* of all our wants (which it to some *624* even *1457*), this being an end to which an *626* *302* would have led with much *322* *67*ty; and since, *179*, *0* is *1454* to us as a *4* *118*, i.e., as one which is to have *95* on the will, *16*, *1452* that *5* *47*ly in the *1451* of her *630* has *298* the means to the end, its true *785* must be to *203* a will, not *24* good as a means to *53* else, but good in *3*, for which *0* was *79* *30*. This will then, *94* not *73* the sole and *243* good, must be the *63* good and the *34* of every other, even of the *236* of *32*. Under these *315*, there is *44* in*295* with the *787* of *5* in the fact that the *1445* of the *0*, which is *629* for the first and un*34*al *49*, does in many ways *1443*, at least in this life, with the *253*ment of the *119*, which is *40* *34*al, *46*, *32*. Nay, it may even *354* it to *44*, *13* *5* *112* *1441* of her *49*. For *0* *790* the *475* of a good will as its *482* *4* *785*, and in *253*ing this *49* is *127* only of a satisf*6* of its own *139* kind, *46* that from the *253*ment of an end, which end again is *85*d by *0* only, *395* that this may *625* many a *1437* to the ends of *33*.

We have then to *1436* the *82* of a will which de*448* to be *795* *408* for *3* and is good *13* a view to *75* *137*, a *82* which *480* *145* in the sound *81* *39*, *1431* *140* to be *658* up than to be *623*, and which in *509* the value of our *6*s *40* takes the first place and *208* the *34* of all the rest. In order to do this, we will take the *82* of duty, which *1429* that of a good will, *31* *1428* *67* *20*ive re*258*ions and *1425*. These, *21*, far from *1424* it, or *798* it *1422*, *140* bring it out by *799* and make it shine forth so much the *1420*.

I omit here all *6*s which are *145* *1419* as in*295* with duty, *31* they may be *283* for this or that *49*, for with these the *72* *25* they are done from duty *10* arise at all, since they even *1418* with it. I also set aside those *6*s which *156* *183* to duty, but to which men have no *247* *33*, *583*ing them *23* they are *801* *411* by some other *33*. For in this case we can *347* *272* *25* the *6* which *621* with duty is done from duty, or from a *802* view. It is much *1411* to make this *239*ion when the *6* *1290*s with duty and the *20* has *277* a *247* *33* to it. For *164*, it is *40* a *171* of duty that a *1408* *8* not over *1407* an in*38*d *1405*; and *1404* there is much *756* the *350* *646*man does not *1401*, but keeps a fixed price for *232*, so that a child buys of him as well as any other. Men are thus *809* *772*; but this is not *184* to make us *620* that the *646*man has so acted from duty and from *1*s of *470*: his own *186* *285*d it; it is out of the *72* in this case to *201* that he might *277* have a *247* *33* in *228* of the *1396*, so that, as it were, from love he *8* give no *186* to one over *86*. Accordingly the *6* was done n*120* from duty nor from *247* *33*, but *24* with a *802* view.

On the other hand, it is a duty to *318* one's life; and, in *616*, *232* has also a *247* *33* to do so. But on this *124* the of *1391* care which most men take for it has no *218* worth, and their maxim has no moral *614*. They *613* their life as duty *210*, no doubt, but not *23* duty *210*. On the other band, if *1388* and *1387* *810* have *227* taken away the *1384* for life; if the *1383* one, *611* in mind, *1381* at his fate *140* than *1380* or *1379*, *235* for death, and yet pre*448* his life *13* *1376* it- not from *33* or fear, but from duty- then his maxim has a moral worth.

To be *594* when we can is a duty; and *277* this, there are many minds so *1375* *402*d that, *13* any other *165* of *815* or self-*29*, they find a *251* in *1371* joy *1370* them and can take *1369* in the satisf*6* of *56* so far as it is their own work. But I *318* that in such a case an *6* of this kind, *21* *139*, *21* *1368* it may be, has *179* no true moral worth, but is on a level with other *33*s, e.g., the *33* to *545*, which, if it is *1367* *247*ed to that which is in fact of *576* *759* and *817* with duty and *61* *545*able, de*448* *1362* and *820*, but not *417*. For the maxim lacks the moral *614*, *46*, that such *6*s be done from duty, not from *33*. Put the case that the mind of that *821* were *1359* by *810* of his own, *1358* all *260* with the lot of *56*, and that, while he still has the power to *604* *56* in *600*, he is not *1354* by their *777* *23* he is *1353* with his own; and now *201* that he tears *9* out of this dead in*149*, and *559* the *6* *13* any *33* to it, but *74* from duty, then first has his *6* its *371* moral worth. Further still; if *5* has put *372* *260* in the heart of this or that man; if he, *169* to be an *1348* man, is by *544* cold and in*103* to the *1313*ings of *56*, *143* *23* in *27* of his own he is *256* with the *187* gift of *1344* and *1343* and *201*s, or even *210*, that *56* *8* have the same- and such a man would *67*ly not be the *1341* *768* of *5*- but if *5* had not *187*ly *1340* him for a *821*, would he not still find in *9* a *219* from *598* to give *9* a far *570* worth than that of a good-*5*d *544* could be? Un*72*ably. It is just in this that the moral worth of the *284* is *249* out which is *1335* the *482* of all, *46*, that he is *594*, not from *33*, but from duty.

To *377* one's own *32* is a duty, at least in*247*ly; for dis*469* with one's *34*, under a *1331* of many *1330* and *831* *833* wants, might *217* *126* a great *1327* to *837* of duty. But here again, *13* *511* to duty, all men have *145* the *611*est and most *1324* *33* to *32*, *23* it is just in this idea that all *33*s are *378* in one total. But the *177* of *32* is often of such a sort that it *729* *1322* with some *33*s, and yet a man *10* form any *178* and *67* *18* of the sum of satisf*6* of all of them which is *43* *32*. It is not then to be *1254*ed at that a *290* *33*, *178* both as to what it *109*s and as to the time *308* which it can be *1318*, is often able to *1317* such a *1316* idea, and that a gouty *840*, for *464*, can *305* to enjoy what he likes, and to *1313* what he may, since, *62* to his *441*, on this *841* at least, he has not *1034*d the *610* of the *152* *593* to a *213* *1007*n *361*ation of a *32* which is *169* to be found in *400*. But even in this case, if the *47* *236* for *32* did not *95* his will, and *590* that in his *122* case *400* was not a *30* *588* in this *441*, there yet *136* in this, as in all other cases, this law, *46*, that he *8* *432* his *32* not from *33* but from duty, and by this would his *129* first *1302* true moral worth.

It is in this *388*, *431*, that we are to *389* those *1299* of Scripture also in which we are *108*ed to love our *1296*, even our enemy. For love, as an *506*ion, *10* be *108*ed, but *1294* for duty's sake may; even *94* we are not *801* to it by any *33*- nay, are even *1293* by a *81* and *1292* *1291*. This is *4* love and not patho*685*- a love which is *1289* in the will, and not in the *586* of sense- in *1*s of *6* and not of *1287* *260*; and it is this love alone which can be *108*ed.

The *119* *98* is: That an *6* done from duty *468*s its moral worth, not from the *49* which is to be *252* by it, but from the maxim by which it is *85*d, and *16* does not *293* on the *575* of the *36* of the *6*, but *24* on the *1* of *80* by which the *6* has taken place, *13* *66* to any *36* of *236*. It is clear from what *1282* that the *49*s which we may have in view in our *6*s, or their *64*s *66*ed as ends and *148*s of the will, *10* give to *6*s any un*34*al or moral worth. In what, then, can their worth lie, if it is not to *855* in the will and in *196* to its *361*ed *64*? It *10* lie *567* but in the *1* of the will *13* *66* to the ends which can be *252* by the *6*. For the will *1275* *147* its a *42* *1*, which is *200*, and its a *711* *148*, which is *329*, as *147* two roads, and as it must be *85*d by *53*, it that it must be *85*d by the *200* *1* of *80* when an *6* is done from duty, in which case every *329* *1* has been *858* from it.

The third *98*, which is a *221* of the two *558*, I would *859* thus Duty is the *28* of *96* from *27* for the law. I may have *33* for an *36* as the *64* of my *565* *6*, but I *10* have *27* for it, just for this *0*, that it is an *64* and not an *1269* of will. Similarly I *10* have *27* for *33*, *25* my own or *86*'s; I can at most, if my own, *1267* it; if *86*'s, *412* even love it; i.e., look on it as *228*able to my own *29*. It is only what is *276* with my will as a *1*, by no means as an *64*- what does not *863* my *33*, but *1262* it, or at least in case of *365* *554* it from its *441*- in other words, *74* the law of *3*, which can be an *36* of *27*, and hence a *108*. Now an *6* done from duty must *83* *1259* the *95* of *33* and with it every *36* of the will, so that *44* *136* which can *85* the will *214* *36*ively the law, and *20*ively pure *27* for this *4* law, and *61* the maxim * that I *8* *419* this law even to the *1255* of all my *33*s.

* A maxim is the *20*ive *1* of *80*. The *36*ive *1* (i.e., that which would also serve *20*ively as a *4* *1* to all *2* *22* if *0* had full power over the *118* of *236*) is the *4* law.

Thus the moral worth of an *6* does not lie in the *64* *361*ed from it, nor in any *1* of *6* which *210* to *401* its *165* from this *361*ed *64*. For all these *64*s- *865* of one's *34* and even the *866* of the *32* of *56*- could have been also *249* about by other *146*, so that for this there would have been no need of the will of a *2* being; *248* it is in this alone that the *63* and un*34*al good can be found. The pre-*1249* good which we call moral can *16* *855* in *44* else than the *18* of law in *3*, which *67*ly is only *11* in a *2* being, in so far as this *18*, and not the *361*ed *64*, *85*s the will. This is a good which is *145* *152* in the *141* who acts *62*ly, and we have not to wait for it to *871* first in the *424*. *

* It might be here *36*ed to me that I take *1244* *306* the word *27* in an *549* *97*, *391* of *154* a *239* *546* of the *72* by a *195* of the *0*. But *31* *27* is a *97*, it is not a *97* *728*d *182* *95*, but is self-*1236* by a *2* *195*, and, *16*, is *876*ally *239* from all *97*s of the *55* kind, which may be *1233* *120* to *33* or fear, What I *265* *267* as a law for me, I *265* with *27*. This *24* *541* the *174* that my will is *1228* to a law, *13* the *1227* of other *95*s on my sense. The *292* *155* of the will by the law, and the *174* of this, is *43* *27*, so that this is *66*ed as an *64* of the law on the *20*, and not as the cause of it. Respect is *121* the *18* of a worth which *1224* my self-love. Accordingly it is *53* which is *231* n*120* as an *36* of *33* nor of fear, *31* it has *53* *889* to both. The *36* of *27* is the law only, and that the law which we *538* on *58* and yet *265* as *30* in *3*. As a law, we are *20*ed too it *13* *1220* self-love; as *533* by us on *58*, it is a *424* of our will. In the *55* *892* it has an *443* to fear, in the *45* to *33*. Respect for a *141* is *121* only *27* for the law (of *470*, etc.) of which he gives us an *164*. Since we also look on the *615* of our *434* as a duty, we *255* that we see in a *141* of *434*, as it were, the *164* of a law (viz., to *126* like him in this by *406*), and this *208* our *27*. All so-*43* moral *29* *240* *74* in *27* for the law.

But what sort of law can that be, the *18* of which must *85* the will, even *13* *1215* any *66* to the *64* *361*ed from it, in order that this will may be *43* good *79* and *13* *543*? As I have *1214* the will of every *376* which could arise to it from *1212* to any law, there *136* *44* but the *7* *183*ity of its *6*s to law in *47*, which alone is to serve the will as a *1*, i.e., I am never to act *106* than so that I could also will that my maxim *8* *126* a *7* law. Here, now, it is the *722* *183*ity to law in *47*, *13* *530* any *122* law *668* to *67* *6*s, that *448* the will as its *1* and must so serve it, if duty is not to be a vain *893* and a *894* *82*. The *54* *0* of men in its *4* *89*s *330*ly *848*s with this and *40* has in view the *1* here *662*. Let the *72* be, for *164*: May I when in *600* make a *109* with the *526* not to keep it? I *347* *272* here *147* the two *692*s which the *72* may have: Whether it is *350*, or *25* it is right, to make a false *109*? The *55* may *431* of be the case. I see *452* *73* that it is not *184* to *521* *101* from a *152* *212* by means of this *1199*, but it must be well *231* *25* there may not *462* *148* from this lie much *322* *1198* than that from which I now free *101*, and as, with all my *169* *898*, the *221*s *10* be so *217* *899* but that *510* once lost may be much more *900* to me than any *1193* which I seek to avoid at *152*, it *8* be *231* *25* it would not be more *350* to act *1192* *62* to a *7* maxim and to make it a habit to *109* *44* *214* with the *526* of *901* it. But it is soon clear to me that such a maxim will still only be based on the fear of *221*s. Now it is a *83* *103* thing to be *1190* from duty and to be so from *1189* of *900* *221*s. In the first case, the very *82* of the *6* *145* *364* a law for me; in the *119* case, I must first look about *902* to see what *424*s may be *378* with it which would *506* *101*. For to *1184* from the *1* of duty is *294* all doubt *1182*; but to be *1181* to my maxim of *189* may often be very *186*ous to me, *31* to abide by it is *67*ly safer. The *1178* way, *21*, and an *905* one, to *358* the *502* to this *72* *25* a lying *109* is *295* with duty, is to ask *101*, "Should I be *469* that my maxim (to *521* *101* from *212* by a false *109*) *8* hold good as a *7* law, for *101* as well as for *56*?" and *8* I be able to say to *101*, "Every one may make a *1172* *109* when he finds *9* in a *212* from which he *10* *106* *521* *9*?" Then I *152*ly *126* aware that while I can will the lie, I can by no means will that lying *8* be a *7* law. For with such a law there would be no *109*s at all, since it would be in vain to *1170* my *526* in *66* to my *352* *6*s to those who would not *620* this *1168*, or if they over *1167* did so would pay me back in my own coin. Hence my maxim, as soon as it *8* be made a *7* law, would *69* *297* *3*.

I do not, *16*, need any far-*1165* *1164* to *223* what I have to do in order that my will may be *381* good. In*38*d in the *912* of the world, in*127* of being *1015*d for all its *1159*, I only ask *101*: Canst thou also will that thy maxim *8* be a *7* law? If not, then it must be *913*, and that not *23* of a dis*186* *1156* from it to *101* or even to *56*, but *23* it *10* enter as a *1* into a *11* *7* *134*, and *0* *1154* from me *292* *27* for such *134*. I do not *73* as yet *223* on what this *27* is based (this the *476* may *345*), but at least I *389* this, that it is an *914* of the worth which far *1150* all worth of what is *1149* by *33*, and that the *28* of *96* from pure *27* for the *4* law is what *208* duty, to which every other *165* must give place, *23* it is the *34* of a will being good in *3*, and the worth of such a will is above *77*.

Thus, then, *13* *1148* the moral *52* of *54* human *0*, we have *1147* at its *1*. And *31*, no doubt, *54* men do not *76* it in such an *344* and *7* form, yet they *40* have it *156* *230* their eyes and use it as the *493* of their *916*. Here it would be easy to show how, with this *917* in hand, men are well able to *272*, in every case that *918*, what is good, what bad, *183*ably to duty or in*295* with it, if, *13* in the least *569* them *75* new, we only, like Socrates, *247* their *429* to the *1* they *50* *1137*; and that, *16*, we do not need *264* and *26* to know what we *8* do to be *1136* and good, yea, even wise and *919*. Indeed we might well have *1134* *230*hand that the *52* of what every man is bound to do, and *16* also to know, would be *308* the reach of every man, even the *54*est. Here we *10* *921* *1131* when we see how great an *186* the *4* *89* has over the *338* in the *54* *39* of men. In the *45*, if *54* *0* *1129* to *1128* from the laws of *38* and from the *1127* of the *282*, it falls into mere *1125* and self-*102*s, at least into a chaos of un*67*ty, *1122*, and *1121*. But in the *4* *923* it is just when the *54* *39* *554* all *128* *148*s from *4* laws that its power of *89* *1118* to show *3* to *186*. It then *126*s even *498*, *25* it be that it *1116* with its own con*264* or with other *299* *27*ing what is to be *43* right, or *25* it *100* for its own *340* to *85* *809* the worth of *6*s; and, in the *45* case, it may even have as good a hope of *1111* the mark as any *476* *92* can *109* *9*. Nay, it is *1109* more sure of doing so, *23* the *476* *10* have any other *1*, while he may *217* *1108* his *89* by a *1107* of *255*ations *270* to the *171*, and so turn aside from the right way. Would it not *16* be wiser in moral *316*s to *1105* in the *89* of *54* *0*, or at most only to call in *26* for the *49* of *798* the *123* of *57* more *243* and *168*, and its rules more *1103* for use (e*187*ly for *1102*), but not so as to draw off the *54* *39* from its happy *1101*, or to bring it by means of *26* into a new path of *317* and *340*?

Innocence is *73* a *1099* thing; only, on the other hand, it is very sad that it *10* well *318* *3* and is *217* *1098*. On this *124* even *787*- which *106* *240* more in *129* than in *52*- yet has need of *264*, not in order to learn from it, but to *377* for its *177*s *1096* and *1095*. Against all the *108*s of duty which *0* re*152*s to man as so de*582* of *27*, he feels in *9* a *463* *1090* in his wants and *33*s, the *1089* satisf*6* of which he sums up under the name of *32*. Now *0* *1088* its *108*s *1087*, *13* *1086* *75* to the *33*s, and, as it were, with dis*66* and *931* for these *299*, which are so *1083*, and at the same time so *1082*, and which will not allow *50* to be *1081* by any *108*. Hence there *268* a *81* *932*, i.e., a *257*, to argue *357* these *258* laws of duty and to *72* their *144*, or at least their *309* and *258*ness; and, if *11*, to make them more *817* with our *235* and *33*s, that is to say, to *1075* them at their very *219*, and *375* to *297* their worth- a thing which even *54* *4* *0* *10* *714* call good.

Thus is the *54* *0* of man *937* to go out of its *923*, and to take a step into the field of a *4* *26*, not to *612* any *99* want (which never *918* to it as long as it is *469* to be mere sound *0*), but even on *4* *216*, in order to *253* in it *1072* and clear *340* *27*ing the *219* of its *1*, and the *426* *155* of it in op*547* to the *37* which are based on wants and *33*s, so that it may *367* from the *939* of *513* *299* and not run the risk of *1066* all *371* moral *1*s *182* the *1065* into which it *217* falls. Thus, when *4* *0* *1064* *3*, there *1063* *268* in it a *1062* which *1061* it to seek aid in *26*, just as *259*s to it in its *497* use; and in this case, *16*, as well as in the other, it will find rest *942* but in a *761* *254* *199* of our *0*.

SECOND SECTION

TRANSITION FROM POPULAR MORAL PHILOSOPHY

TO THE METAPHYSIC OF MORALS

If we have *501* drawn our *82* of duty from the *54* use of our *4* *0*, it is by no means to be *1058* that we have *1057* it as an *41* *82*. On the *88*, if we *943* to the *38* of men's *129*, we meet *1055* and, as we *58* allow, just *1054* that one *10* find a *290* *67* *164* of the *257* to act from pure duty. Al*94* many *93* are done in *183*ity with what duty *945*, it is *179* *40* *946* *25* they are done *258*ly from duty, so as to have a moral worth. Hence there have at all times been *476*s who have *278* *947* that this *257* *161* *480* at all in human *6*s, and have *366*d *77* to a more or less *1047* self-love. Not that they have on that *124* *72*ed the *505* of the *18* of *19*; on the *88*, they spoke with *949* *1044* of the *1043* and *535* of human *5*, which, *94* noble *184* to take its rule an idea so *271* of *27*, is yet weak to *419* it and *1042* *0* which ought to give it the law only for the *49* of *1041* for the *29* of the *33*s, *25* *1040* or at the best in the *197* *11* *517* with one *86*.

In fact, it is *79* im*11* to make out by *38* with *243* *67*ty a *290* case in which the maxim of an *6*, *21* right in *3*, *1037* *74* on moral *216* and on the *18* of duty. Sometimes it *259*s that with the *1036* self-*199* we can find *44* *1035* the moral *1* of duty which could have been *463* *184* to move us to this or that *6* and to so great a *1034*; yet we *10* from this infer with *67*ty that it was not *156* some *519* *376* of self-love, under the false *233* of duty, that was the *373* *105* cause of the will. We like them to f*45* *58* by *953* *1027* *510* for a more noble *165*; *248* in fact we can never, even by the *258*est *199*, get *227* *306* the *519* *148*s of *6*; since, when the *72* is of moral worth, it is not with the *6*s which we see that we are *316*ed, but with those *955* *1*s of them which we do not see.

Moreover, we *10* *173* serve the *235* of those who *956* all *19* as a mere *1022* of human *524* over *1020* *3* from *815*, than by *1019* to them that *82*s of duty must be drawn only from *38* (as from *1017*, *1016* are ready to think is also the case with all other *82*s); for or is to *1015* for them a *67* *1014*. I am *450* to admit out of love of *110* that even most of our *6*s are *426*, but if we look *779* at them we *1011* come upon the dear self which is *40* *1010*, and it is this they have in view and not the *258* *108* of duty which would often *285* self-*1009*. Without being an enemy of *202*, a cool *1008*, one that does not *1007* the wish for good, *21* *528*, for its *185*, may *412* doubt *25* true *202* is *161* found *567* in the world, and this e*187*ly as years *958* and the *89* is *447* made wiser by *38* and *447*, also, more acute in *1002*. This being so, *44* can *377* us from *1001* away *278* from our ideas of duty, or *318* in the soul a well-*222*ed *27* for its law, but the clear *959* that *31* there *8* never have been *6*s which *156* *998* from such pure *219*s, yet *25* this or that takes place is not at all the *72*; but that *0* of *3*, *163* on all *38*, *531* what ought to take place, that *62*ly *6*s of which *143* the world has *501* never given an *164*, the *960* even of which might be very much *995* by one who *994* *77* on *38*, are *179* *993* *108*ed by *0*; that, e.g., even *94* there might never yet have been a *949* *992*, yet not a whit the less is pure *991* in *990* *285*d of every man, *23*, prior to all *38*, this duty is *446* as duty in the idea of a *0* *105* the will by a *42* *1*s.

When we add *137* that, *310* we deny that the *82* of *19* has any truth or *196* to any *11* *36*, we must admit that its law must be valid, not *24* for men but for all *2* *386*s *47*ly, not *24* under *67* *181* *34*s or with *214*ions but with *117* *28*, then it is clear that no *38* could *428* us to infer even the *190* of such *536* laws. For with what right could we bring into *983* *27* as a *7* *177* for every *2* *5* that which *143* holds only under the *181* *34*s of *110*? Or how could laws of the *155* of our will be *66*ed as laws of the *155* of the will of *2* *22* *47*ly, and for us only as such, if they were *24* *41* and did not take their *458* *83* a *42* from pure but *4* *0*?

Nor could *75* be more fatal to *19* than that we *8* wish to *468* it from *164*s. For every *164* of it that is set *230* me must be first *3* *981* by *1*s of *19*, *25* it is *271* to serve as an *458*al *164*, i.e., as a *979*; but by no means can it *886*itatively *382* the *18* of *19*. Even the Holy One of the Gospels must first be *975* with our ideal of moral *159* *230* we can *265* Him as such; and so He says of Himself, "Why call ye Me (whom you see) good; none is good (the model of good) but God only (whom ye do not see)?" But *598* have we the *18* of God as the *63* good? Simply from the idea of moral *159*, which *0* *963* a *42* and *964* *539* with the *82* of a free will. Imitation finds no place at all in *19*, and *164*s serve only for *820*, i.e., they put *294* doubt the *960* of what the law *108*s, they make *970* that which the *4* rule *438* more *47*ly, but they can never *886*ize us to set aside the true *458*al which lies in *0* and to guide *58* by *164*s.

If then there is no *371* *63* *1* of *19* but what must rest *74* on pure *0*, *163* of all *38*, I think it is not *30* even to put the *72* *25* it is good to *967* these *195*s in their *47*ity (in *344*o) as they are *436* a *42* along with the *1*s *87* to them, if our *52* is to be *158* from the *977* and to be *43* *291*.

In our times *73* this might *143* be *30*; for if we *980* votes *25* pure *2* *52* *422*d from *77* *41*, that is to say, *60* of *57*, or *25* *204* *4* *26* is to be *999*, it is easy to guess which side would *1004*.

This *736* to *204* *82*s is *67*ly very *1005*, if the *1023* to the *1*s of pure *0* has first taken place and been *1025* *659*. This *364* that we first found *229* on *60*s, and then, when it is *954* *436*, *669* a *1028* for it by *154* it a *204* *284*. But it is quite *1029* to try to be *204* in the first *317*, on which the *505* of the *1*s *293*s. It is not only that this *734* can never lay claim to the very rare merit of a true *291* *204*ity, since there is no art in being *168* if one *1045* all *761*ness of *453*; but also it *203*s a *1050* *1051* of *1052* *1002*s and half-*0*ed *1*s. Shallow pates enjoy this *23* it can be used for every-day chat, but the *1060* find in it only *683*, and being *833* and *940* to help *50*, they turn away their eyes, while *476*s, who see quite well *182* this *893*, are *372* *1068* to when they call men off for a time from this *529*ed *204*ity, in order that they might be *1074* *204* after they have *252* a *178* *453*.

We need only look at the *936* of *660* in that *228*ite *934*, and we shall find at one time the *187* *225* of human *5* (*933*, *21*, the idea of a *2* *5* *47*ly), at one time *159*, at *86* *32*, here moral sense, there fear of God. a *372* of this, and a *372* of that, in *1080* *1084*, *13* its *1110* to them to ask *25* the *1*s of *19* are to be *564* in the *52* of human *5* at all (which we can have only from *38*); or, if this is not so, if these *1*s are to be found *278* a *42*, free from *77* *41*, in pure *2* *195*s only and *942* else, not even in the *929* *211*; then *140* to adopt the *449* of *387* this a *422* *317*, as pure *4* *26*, or (if one may use a name so *1115*) as *60* of *57*, * to bring it by *3* to *243*ness, and to *285* the *576*, which *235* for *204* *585*, to await the issue of this under*1027*.

* Just as pure *925* are *158* from *312*, pure logic from *312*, so if we *305* we may also *272* pure *26* of *57* (*60*) from *312* (viz., *312* to human *5*). By this *924* we are also at once *1120* that moral *1*s are not based on *139*ties of human *5*, but must *430* a *42* of *50*, while from such *1*s *4* rules must be *127* of being *398* for every *2* *5*, and *62*ly for that of man.

Such a *60* of *57*, *227* *1135*, not mixed with any *324*, *1140*, *226*, or hyper*226*, and still less with *1142* *433* (which we might call hypo*125*), is not only an *418* *1151* of all sound *338* *52* of *91*, but is at the same time a *1162* of the *482* *311* to the *373* *910* of their *177*s. For the pure *18* of duty, *909* with any *270* *616* of *41* attr*6*s, and, in a word, the *18* of the moral law, *406*s on the human heart, by way of *0* alone (which first *126*s aware with this that it can of *3* be *4*), an *95* so much more *463* than all other *148*s * which may be *468*d from the field of *38*, that, in the *174* of its worth, it *1177* the *45*, and can by *211*s *126* their *1186*; *248* a mixed *229*, *1187* *447* of *165*s drawn from *97*s and *33*s, and *447* also of *18*s of *0*, must make the mind waver *147* *165*s which *10* be *249* under any *1*, which lead to good only by mere *1191* and very often also to evil.

* I have a *1194* from the late *1196* Sulzer, in which he asks me what can be the *0* that moral *340*, *31* *281*ing much that is *896* for the *0*, yet *1205* so *372*? My *502* was *474* in order that I might make it *243*. But it is *74* this: that the *1208* *50* have not got their own *82*s clear, and when they *551* to make up for this by *1218* up *165*s of moral *780* from every *891*, *1222* to make their *1223* right *611*, they spoil it. For the *54*est *39* shows that if we *1226*, on the one hand, an act of *470* done with *1230* mind, apart from every view to *186* of any kind in this world or *86*, and even under the *197* *1231* of *28* or *1232*, and, on the other hand, a *1234* act which was *192*, in *21* low a *211*, by a *270* *165*, the *55* *883* far *306* and *882* the *119*; it *1235* the soul and *733*s the wish to be able to act in like *388* *266*. Even *1239* young *877* feel this *1241*, ana one *8* never re*152* *91* to them in any other light.

From what has been said, it is clear that all moral *18*s have their seat and *458* *227* a *42* in the *0*, and that, *303*, in the *54*est *0* just as truly as in that which is in the *482* *211* *99*; that they *10* be *676*ed by abstr*6* from any *41*, and *16* *24* *181*, *52*; that it is just this *309* of their *458* that makes them *271* to serve as our *63* *4* *1*, and that just in *1246* as we add *75* *41*, we *1247* from their *371* *95* and from the *117* value of *6*s; that it is not only of the *197* *28*, in a *870* *99* point of view, but is also of the *197* *4* *311*, to *468* these *82*s and laws from pure *0*, to *152* them pure and *909*, and even to *85* the *917* of this *4* or pure *2* *52*, i.e., to *85* the whole *118* of pure *4* *0*; and, in doing so, we must not make its *1*s *293*ent on the *122* *5* of human *0*, *94* in *99* *26* this may be *868*, or may even at times be *30*; but since moral laws ought to hold good for every *2* *386*, we must *468* them from the *47* *195* of a *2* being. In this way, *31* for its *487* to man *19* has need of *324*, yet, in the first *464*, we must treat it *163*ly as pure *26*, i.e., as *60*, *243* in *3* (a thing which in such *239* *1252* of *264* is *217* done); *1253* well that *310* we are in *410* of this, it would not only be vain to *85* the moral *588* of duty in right *6*s for *49*s of *99* *1263*, but it would be im*11* to base *57* on their *371* *1*s, even for *54* *4* *49*s, e*187*ly of moral *340*, so as to *203* pure moral *257*s, and to *1268* them on men's minds to the *866* of the *197* *11* good in the world.

But in order that in this study we may not *24* *860* by the *81* steps from the *54* moral *89* (in this case very *271* of *27*) to the *291*, as has been *145* done, but also from a *204* *26*, which goes no *137* than it can reach by *1270* with the help of *164*s, to *60* (which does allow *3* to be *1272* by *75* *41* and, as it must *1273* the whole *624* of this kind of *2* *52*, goes as far as ideal *18*s, where even *164*s fail us), we must *419* and *452* *1276* the *4* *118* of *0*, from the *47* rules of its *155* to the point where the *82* of duty *148*s from it.

Everything in *5* works *62* to laws. Rational *22* alone have the *118* of *96* *62* to the *18* of laws, that is *62* to *1*s, i.e., have a will. Since the *560* of *6*s from *1*s *210* *0*, the will is *44* but *4* *0*. If *0* *1283* *85*s the will, then the *6*s of such a being which are *265*d as *36*ively *30* are *20*ively *30* also, i.e., the will is a *118* to *305* that only which *0* *163* of *33* *265*s as *4*ly *30*, i.e., as good. But if *0* of *3* does not *355*ly *85* the will, if the *45* is *20* also to *20*ive *34*s (*122* *376*s) which do not *40* *848* with the *36*ive *34*s; in a word, if the will does not in *3* *227* *1290* with *0* (which is *161* the case with men), then the *6*s which *36*ively are *265*d as *30* are *20*ively *181*, and the *155* of such a will *62* to *36*ive laws is *116*, that is to say, the *90* of the *36*ive laws to a will that is not *761*ly good is *76*d as the *155* of the will of a *2* being by *1*s of *0*, but which the will from its *5* does not of *28* *419*.

The *18* of an *36*ive *1*, in so far as it is *1303* for a will, is *43* a *108* (of *0*), and the *191* of the *108* is *43* an *12*.

All *12*s are *286* by the word ought [or shall], and *112* *839* the *90* of an *36*ive law of *0* to a will, which from its *20*ive *225* is not *69* *85*d by it (an *116*). They say that *53* would be good to do or to *921*, but they say it to a will which does not *40* do a thing *23* it is *76*d to be good to do it. That is *4*ly good, *21*, which *85*s the will by means of the *18*s of *0*, and *61* not from *20*ive *146*, but *36*ively, that is on *1*s which are valid for every *2* being as such. It is *158* from the *838*, as that which *95*s the will only by means of *320* from *24* *20*ive *146*, valid only for the sense of this or that one, and not as a *1* of *0*, which holds for every one. *

* The *293*ence of the *100* on *320*s is *43* *33*, and this *62*ly *40* *834* a want. The *293*ence of a *181*ly *832* will on *1*s of *0* is *43* an *29*. This *16*, is found only in the case of a *293*ent will which does not *40* of *3* *183* to *0*; in the Divine will we *10* *76* any *29*. But the human will can also take an *29* in a thing *13* *16* *96* from *29*. The *55* *541* the *4* *29* in the *6*, the *45* the patho*685* in the *36* of the *6*. The *55* *834* only *293*ence of the will on *1*s of *0* in *50*; the *119*, *293*ence on *1*s of *0* for the sake of *33*, *0* *471*ing only the *4* rules how the *285*ment of the *33* may be *1338*. In the first case the *6* *29*s me; in the *119* the *36* of the *6* (*23* it is *838* to me). We have seen in the first *151* that in an *6* done from duty we must look not to the *29* in the *36*, but only to that in the *6* *3*, and in its *2* *1* (viz., the law).

A *330*ly good will would *16* be *394* *20* to *36*ive laws (viz., laws of good), but could not be *76*d as *825* *112* to act *1339*, *23* of *3* from its *20*ive *225* it can only be *85*d by the *18* of good. Therefore no *12*s hold for the Divine will, or in *47* for a holy will; ought is here out of place, *23* the *80* is *145* of *3* *69* in *1342* with the law. Therefore *12*s are only *191*e to *859* the *90* of *36*ive laws of all *80* to the *20*ive im*159* of the will of this or that *2* being, e.g., the human will.

Now all *12*s *108* *120* *162*ly or *35*ly. The *55* re*152* the *4* *28* of a *11* *6* as means to *53* else that is *818* (or at least which one might *213* will). The *35* *12* would be that which re*152*ed an *6* as *30* of *3* *13* *196* to *86* end, i.e., as *36*ively *30*.

Since every *4* law re*152*s a *11* *6* as good and, on this *124*, for a *20* who is *4*ly *832* by *0*, *30*, all *12*s are *191*e *105* an *6* which is *30* *62* to the *1* of a will good in some *27*s. If now the *6* is good only as a means to *53* else, then the *12* is *162*; if it is *76*d as good in *3* and *61* as being *69* the *1* of a will which of *3* *183*s to *0*, then it is *35*.

Thus the *12* *813* what *6* *11* by me would be good and *152*s the *4* rule in *90* to a will which does not *1377* *583* an *6* *74* *23* it is good, *25* *23* the *20* does not *40* know that it is good, or *23*, even if it know this, yet its *37* might be *584* to the *36*ive *1*s of *4* *0*.

Accordingly the *162* *12* only says that the *6* is good for some *49*, *11* or *373*. In the first case it is a *331*atical, in the *119* an *808* *4* *1*. The *35* *12* which *813* an *6* to be *36*ively *30* in *3* *13* *196* to any *49*, i.e., *13* any other end, is valid as an *536* (*4*) *1*.

Whatever is *11* only by the power of some *2* being may also be *76*d as a *11* *49* of some will; and *16* the *1*s of *6* as *66*s the means *30* to *253* some *11* *49* are in fact *587* *968*. All *264*s have a *4* part, *804* of *331*s *859*ing that some end is *11* for us and of *12*s *247*ing how it may be *252*. These may, *16*, be *43* in *47* *12*s of skill. Here there is no *72* *25* the end is *2* and good, but only what one must do in order to *253* it. The *177*s for the *1223*ian to make his *840* *761*ly *400*y, and for a *1423* to *1432* *67* death, are of equal value in this *27*, that each *448* to *64* its *49* *330*ly. Since in early youth it *10* be known what ends are *796* to occur to us in the *912* of life, *1434* seek to have their *877* *623* a great many *93*, and *794* for their skill in the use of means for all sorts of *437* ends, of none of which can they *85* *25* it may not *143* *462* be an *36* to their pupil, but which it is at all *792* *11* that he might aim at; and this *791* is so great that they *54*ly *589* to form and *426* their *89* on the value of the *93* which may be *788* as ends.

There is one end, *21*, which may be *172*d to be *161* such to all *2* *22* (so far as *12*s apply to them, viz., as *293*ent *22*), and, *16*, one *49* which they not *24* may have, but which we may with *67*ty *172* that they all *161* have by a *81* *28*, and this is *32*. The *162* *12* which *438* the *4* *28* of an *6* as means to the *786* of *32* is *808*. We are not to *152* it as *30* for an un*67* and *24* *11* *49*, but for a *49* which we may pre*201* with *67*ty and a *42* in every man, *23* it *133* to his being. Now skill in the *365* of means to his own *197* well-being may be *43* *189*, * in the *1449* sense. And thus the *12* which *784* to the *365* of means to one's own *32*, i.e., the *177* of *189*, is still *40* *162*; the *6* is not *108*ed *79*, but only as means to *86* *49*.

* The word *189* is taken in two *282*: in the one it may bear the name of *52* of the world, in the other that of *325* *189*. The *55* is a man's *1456* to *95* *56* so as to use them for his own *49*s. The *45* is the *1459* to *1466* all these *49*s for his own *1469* *604*. This *45* is *121* that to which the value even of the *55* is *354*d, and when a man is *350* in the *55* sense, but not in the *45*, we might *173* say of him that he is *1477* and *898*, but, on the whole, im*350*.

Finally, there is an *12* which *108*s a *67* *129* *267*, *13* *775* as its *34* any other *49* to be *252* by it. This *12* is *35*. It *316*s not the *171* of the *6*, or its *472* *424*, but its form and the *1* of which it is *3* a *424*; and what is *444*ly good in it *240* in the *1505* *257*, let the *221* be what it may. This *12* may be *43* that of *19*.

There is a *1513* *239*ion also *147* the *80*s on these three sorts of *1*s in the dis*1234*ity of the *116* of the will. In order to mark this *301* more *452*, I think they would be most *769* named in their order if we said they are *120* rules of skill, or *440* of *189*, or *108*s (laws) of *19*. For it is law only that *323* the *18* of an un*34*al and *36*ive *28*, which is *61* *7*ly valid; and *108*s are laws which must be *1538*, that is, must be *419*ed, even in op*547* to *33*. Counsels, *73*, *625* *28*, but one which can only hold under a *181* *20*ive *34*, viz., they *293* on *25* this or that man *409*s this or that as part of his *32*; the *35* *12*, on the *88*, is not *764* by any *34*, and as being *79*, *31* *4*ly, *30*, may be quite *121* *43* a *108*. We might also call the first kind of *12*s *1539* (*87* to art), the *119* *445* * (to *300*), the third moral (*87* to free *129* *47*ly, that is, to *57*).

* It seems to me that the *139* *692* of the word *445* may be most *1540* *696*d in this way. For *1542* are *43* *445* which flow *121* not from the law of the *1544* as *30* *1546*, but from *1549* for the *47* *300*. A *1559* is *1569* *445*ally when it *752* *189*, i.e., *1584* the world how it can *794* for its *29*s *173*, or at least as well as, the men of *55* time.

Now *268* the *72*, how are all these *12*s *11*? This *72* does not seek to know how we can *76* the *1561*ment of the *6* which the *12* *531*, but *24* how we can *76* the *116* of the will which the *12* *438*. No *187* *326* is *1594* to show how an *12* of skill is *11*. Whoever wills the end, wills also (so far as *0* *742*s his *129*) the means in his power which are *672* *30* *411*. This *98* is, as *66*s the *80*, *327*; for, in *450* an *36* as my *64*, there is *145* *94*t the *70* of *101* as an *96* cause, that is to say, the use of the means; and the *12* *1615* from the *18* of *80* of an end the *18* of *6*s *30* to this end. Synthetical *98*s must no doubt be *380* in *1622* the means to a *565* end; but they do not *316* the *1*, the act of the will, but the *36* and its *575*. E.g., that in order to *1624* a line on an *905* *1* I must draw from its *1633* two *1640* arcs; this no doubt is *623* by *925* only in *307*al *98*s; but if I know that it is only by this *1645* that the *472* *606* can be *583*ed, then to say that, if I fully will the *606*, I also will the *6* *285*d for it, is an *327* *98*; for it is one and the same thing to *76* *53* as an *64* which I can *203* in a *67* way, and to *76* *101* as *96* in this way.

If it were only *394* easy to give a *178* *18* of *32*, the *12*s of *189* would *1658* *607* with those of skill, and would *166* be *327*. For in this case as in that, it could be said: "Whoever wills the end, wills also (*62* to the *1669* of *0* *69*) the *418* means *411* which are in his power." But, *1383*ly, the *82* of *32* is so in*178* that *31* every man *235* to *253* it, yet he never can say *178*ly and *295*ly what it is that he *156* *235* and wills. The *0* of this is that all the *588*s which *234* to the *82* of *32* are *278* *41*, i.e., they must be *401*ed from *38*, and *179* the idea of *32* *210* an *117* whole, a *1680* of *300* in my *152* and all *352* *315*. Now it is im*11* that the most clear-*723* and at the same time most *463* being (*169* *1684*) *8* frame to *9* a *178* *18* of what he *156* wills in this. Does he will *741*, how much *791*, envy, and *1689* might he not *112* draw upon his *8*ers? Does he will *52* and *223*ment, *143* it might prove to be only an eye so much the *1692* to show him so much the more *1694* the evils that are now *1697* from him, and that *10* be *1700*, or to *538* more wants on his *100*, which *145* give him *316* *184*. Would he have long life? who *1702* to him that it would not be a long *1703*? would he at least have *400*? how often has *1716* of the body *1720* from *1724* into which *330* *400* would have *709* one to fall? and so on. In short, he is *940*, on any *1*, to *85* with *67*ty what would make him truly happy; *23* to do so he would need to be *1730*. We *10* *16* act on any *178* *1*s to *377* *32*, but only on *41* *440*, e.g. of *1735*, *1737*, *1742*, *704*, etc., which *38* *752* do, on the *1743*, most *432* well-being. Hence it *114* that the *12*s of *189* do not, *258*ly *460*, *108* at all, that is, they *10* *152* *6*s *36*ively as *4*ly *30*; that they are *140* to be *66*ed as *440* (*1746*) than *177*s *177*s of *0*, that the *331* to *85* *67*ly and *7*ly what *6* would *432* the *32* of a *2* being is *227* *1748*, and *61* no *12* *27*ing it is *11* which *8*, in the *258* sense, *108* to do what makes happy; *23* *32* is not an ideal of *0* but of *524*, *698* *490* on *41* *216*, and it is vain to *361* that these *8* *696* an *6* by which one could *253* the *695* of a *694* of *221*s which is *156* *1752*. This *12* of *189* would *21* be an *327* *98* if we *172* that the means to *32* could be *67*ly *466*; for it is *158* from the *12* of skill only by this, that in the *45* the end is *24* *11*, in the *55* it is given; as *21* both only *1754* the means to that which we *201* to be *818* as an end, it *114* that the *12* which *531* the *450* of the means to him who wills the end is in both cases *327*. Thus there is no *212* in *66* to the *190* of an *12* of this kind *120*.

On the other hand, the *72* how the *12* of *19* is *11*, is *431* one, the only one, *654*ing a *546*, as this is not at all *162*, and the *36*ive *28* which it *152*s *10* rest on any *237*, as is the case with the *162* *12*s. Only here we must never leave out of *255*ation that we *10* make out by any *164*, in other words *41*ly, *25* there is such an *12* at all, but it is *140* to be *1758* that all those which seem to be *35* may yet be at *686* *162*. For *464*, when the *177* is: "Thou shalt not *109* *1172*ly"; and it is *172*d that the *28* of this is not a mere *1768* to avoid some other evil, so that it *8* mean: "Thou shalt not make a lying *109*, lest if it *126* known thou *8*st *297* thy *510*," but that an *6* of this kind must be *66*ed as evil in *3*, so that the *12* of the *1778* is *35*; then we *10* show with *67*ty in any *164* that the will was *85*d *24* by the law, *13* any other *148* of *6*, *31* it may *871* to be so. For it is *40* *11* that fear of *1781*, *143* also *549* dread of other *1175*s, may have a *519* *95* on the will. Who can prove by *38* the non-*206* of a cause when all that *38* tells us is that we do not *679* it? But in such a case the so-*43* moral *12*, which as such *423* to be *35* and un*34*al, would in *185* be only a *445* *177*, *1786* our *429* to our own *29*s and *24* *569* us to take these into *255*ation.

We shall *16* have to *674* a *42* the *190* of a *35* *12*, as we have not in this case the *186* of its *185* being given in *38*, so that [the *1788* of] its *190* *8* be *629* only for its *326*, not for its *475*. In the *1791* it may be *223*ed *230*hand that the *35* *12* alone has the *1797* of a *4* law; all the rest may *73* be *43* *1*s of the will but not laws, since *92* is only *30* for the *253*ment of some *437* *49* may be *231* as in *3* *181*, and we can at any time be free from the *177* if we give up the *49*; on the *88*, the un*34*al *108* *883* the will no *673* to *305* the *513*; *61* it alone *1800* with it that *28* which we *285* in a law.

Secondly, in the case of this *35* *12* or law of *19*, the *212* (of *223*ing its *190*) is a very *1810* one. It is an a *42* *307*al *4* *98*; * and as there is so much *212* in *223*ing the *190* of *99* *98*s of this kind, it may *347* be *169* that the *212* will be no less with the *4*.

* I *1811* the act with the will *13* pre*590* any *34* *424*ing from any *33*, but a *42*, and *16* *69* (*94* only *36*ively, i.e., *530* the idea of a *0* *491*ing full power over all *20*ive *165*s). This is *62*ly a *4* *98* which does not *664* the *450* of an *6* by mere *356* from *86* *145* pre*169* (for we have not such a *330* will), but *964* it *267* with the *18* of the will of a *2* being, as *53* not *281*ed in it.

In this *331* we will first *345* *25* the mere *18* of a *35* *12* may not *143* *471* us also with the *191* of it, *281*ing the *98* which alone can be a *35* *12*; for even if we know the tenor of such an *117* *108*, yet how it is *11* will *285* *137* *187* and *1856* study, which we *1857* to the last *151*.

When I *76* a *162* *12*, in *47* I do not know *230*hand what it will *281* until I am given the *34*. But when I *76* a *35* *12*, I know at once what it *205*. For as the *12* *205* *277* the law only the *28* that the *37* * shall *183* to this law, while the law *205* no *34*s re*258*ing it, there *136* *44* but the *47* *1870* that the maxim of the *6* *8* *183* to a *7* law, and it is this *183*ity alone that the *12* *121* re*152*s as *30*.

* A maxim is a *20*ive *1* of *6*, and must be *158* from the *36*ive *1*, *46*, *4* law. The *55* *205* the *4* rule set by *0* *62* to the *34*s of the *20* (often its *1872* or its *33*s), so that it is the *1* on which the *20* acts; but the law is the *36*ive *1* valid for every *2* being, and is the *1* on which it ought to act that is an *12*.

There is *16* but one *35* *12*, *46*, this: Act only on that maxim *652* thou canst at the same time will that it *8* *126* a *7* law.

Now if all *12*s of duty can be *398* from this one *12* as from their *1*, then, *31* it *8* *392* un*742*d what is *43* duty is not *24* a vain *82*, yet at least we shall be able to show what we *389* by it and what this *82* means.

Since the *7*ity of the law *62* to which *64*s are *203*d *208* what is *121* *43* *5* in the most *47* sense (as to form), that is the *206* of *93* so far as it is *85*d by *47* laws, the *12* of duty may be *286* thus: Act as if the maxim of thy *6* were to *126* by thy will a *7* law of *5*.

We will now *1891* a few *91*, *1895* the usual *342* of them into *91* to *58* and *58* and to *56*, and into *330* and im*330* *91*. *

* It must be noted here that I *704* the *342* of *91* for a *352* *60* of *57*; so that I give it here only as an *437* one (in order to *1923* my *164*s). For the rest, I *389* by a *330* duty one that *628* no *214*ion in *228* of *33* and then I have not *24* *335* but also *641* *330* *91*. This is *88* to the use of the word *337* in the *1930*; but I do not *1935* to *1945* there, as it is all one for my *49* *25* it is *631* or not.

1. A man *354*d to *1965* by a *694* of mis*740*s feels *1983* of life, but is still so far in *410* of his *0* that he can ask *9* *25* it would not be *88* to his duty to *9* to take his own life. Now he *345*s *25* the maxim of his *6* could *126* a *7* law of *5*. His maxim is: "From self-love I adopt it as a *1* to *1094* my life when its *1960* *1928* is *796* to bring more evil than satisf*6*." It is asked then *74* *25* this *1* *314* on self-love can *126* a *7* law of *5*. Now we see at once that a *123* of *5* of which it *8* be a law to *297* life by means of the very *97* whose *187* *5* it is to impel to the *615* of life would *224* *3* and, *16*, could not exist as a *123* of *5*; hence that maxim *10* *213* exist as a *7* law of *5* and, *61*, would be *83* in*295* with the *63* *1* of all duty.

2. Another finds *9* *488* by *28* to *401* money. He knows that he will not be able to repay it, but sees also that *44* will be lent to him *310* he *109*s *1927* to repay it in a *178* time. He *100* to make this *109*, but he has still so much con*264* as to ask *9*: "Is it not *1884* and in*295* with duty to get out of a *212* in this way?" Suppose *21* that he *1672*s to do so: then the maxim of his *6* would be *286* thus: "When I think *101* in want of money, I will *401* money and *109* to repay it, *31* I know that I never can do so." Now this *1* of self-love or of one's own *186* may *143* be *295* with my whole *352* *300*; but the *72* now is, "Is it right?" I *1868* then the *656* of self-love into a *7* law, and state the *72* thus: "How would it be if my maxim were a *7* law?" Then I see at once that it could never hold as a *7* law of *5*, but would *69* *224* *3*. For *590* it to be a *7* law that *232* when he *479* *9* in a *212* *8* be able to *109* *92* he *622*, with the *49* of not *901* his *109*, the *109* *3* would *126* im*11*, as well as the end that one might have in view in it, since no one would *255* that *75* was *109*d to him, but would *956* all such *1851* as vain *1845*.

3. A third finds in *9* a *655* which with the help of some *1844* might make him a *283* man in many *27*s. But he finds *9* in *1822* *315* and p*784* to *1757* in *251* *140* than to take pains in *1753* and im*1717* his happy *81* *630*. He asks, *21*, *25* his maxim of *589* of his *81* gifts, *277* *1747* with his *33* to *702*, *621* also with what is *43* duty. He sees then that a *123* of *5* could *73* *430* with such a *7* law *31* men (like the South Sea *1729*) *8* let their *434* rest and *1672* to *1668* their lives *24* to *1667*, *1646*, and *1621* of their *1619*- in a word, to *610*; but he *10* *213* will that this *8* be a *7* law of *5*, or be *626* in us as such by a *81* *302*. For, as a *2* being, he *69* wills that his *369* be *1436*ed, since they serve him and have been given him, for all sorts of *11* *49*s.

4. A *1604*, who is in *550*, while he sees that *56* have to *1595* with great *1593* and that he could help them, *479*: "What *316* is it of mine? Let *232* be as happy as Heaven *622*, or as he can make *9*; I will take *44* from him nor even envy him, only I do not wish to *597* *75* to his *300* or to his *1536* in *600*!" Now no doubt if such a mode of *595* were a *7* law, the human race might very well *430* and *1529* even *173* than in a state in which *232* talks of *260* and good-will, or even takes care *841*ally to put it into *1479*, but, on the other side, also *1474* when he can, *1446* the *789* of men, or *106* *827*s them. But *31* it is *11* that a *7* law of *5* might exist in *806* with that maxim, it is im*11* to will that such a *1* *8* have the *7* *144* of a law of *5*. For a will which *1402* this would *224* *3*, *279* as many cases might occur in which one would have need of the love and *260* of *56*, and in which, by such a law of *5*, *1386* from his own will, he would *1373* *9* of all hope of the aid he *100*.

These are a few of the many *373* *91*, or at least what we *66* as such, which *1185*ly fall into two *1364* on the one *1* that we have laid down. We must be able to will that a maxim of our *6* *8* be a *7* law. This is the canon of the moral *1351* of the *6* *47*ly. Some *6*s are of such a *284* that their maxim *10* *13* *102* be even *76*d as a *7* law of *5*, far from it being *11* that we *8* will that it *8* be so. In *56* this *218* im*190* is not found, but still it is im*11* to will that their maxim *8* be *826* to the *7*ity of a law of *5*, since such a will would *224* *3* It is *217* seen that the *55* *827* *258* or *1329* (*836*) duty; the *45* only laxer (*573*) duty. Thus it has been *227* shown how all *91* *293* as *66*s the *5* of the *116* (not the *36* of the *6*) on the same *1*.

If now we *943* to *58* on *841* of any *837* of duty, we shall find that we in fact do not will that our maxim *8* be a *7* law, for that is im*11* for us; on the *88*, we will that the *513* *8* *392* a *7* law, only we *172* the *673* of *387* an *214*ion in our own *228* or (just for this time only) in *228* of our *33*. Consequently if we *231* all cases from one and the same point of view, *46*, that of *0*, we *8* find a *102* in our own will, *46*, that a *67* *1* *8* be *36*ively *30* as a *7* law, and yet *20*ively *8* not be *7*, but admit of *214*ions. As *21* we at one *593* *66* our *6* from the point of view of a will *83* *183*ed to *0*, and then again look at the same *6* from the point of view of a will *192* by *33*, there is not *156* any *102*, but an *1315* of *33* to the *177* of *0*, *652* the *7*ity of the *1* is *1311* into a mere *47*ity, so that the *4* *1* of *0* shall meet the maxim half way. Now, *31* this *10* be *842* in our own *745* *89*, yet it *568* that we do *156* *265* the *144* of the *35* *12* and (with all *27* for it) only allow *58* a few *214*ions, which we think un*614*ant and *488* from us.

We have thus *436* at least this much, that if duty is a *18* which is to have any *614* and real *405* *374* for our *6*s, it can only be *286* in *35* and not at all in *162* *12*s. We have also, which is of great *311*, *967*ed *452* and *178*ly for every *4* *487* the *469* of the *35* *12*, which must *281* the *1* of all duty if there is such a thing at all. We have not yet, *21*, *849* so far as to prove a *42* that there *161* is such an *12*, that there is a *4* law which *108*s *79* of *3* and *13* any other *376*, and that the *419*ing of this law is duty.

With the view of *253*ing to this, it is of *561* *311* to re*107* that we must not allow *58* to think of *1257* the *185* of this *1* from the *122* *499*s of human *5*. For duty is to be a *4*, un*34*al *28* of *6*; it must *16* hold for all *2* *22* (to whom an *12* can apply at all), and for this *0* only be also a law for all human wills. On the *88*, *92* is *398* from the *122* *81* *284*istics of *110*, from *67* *97*s and *586*, nay, even, if *11*, from any *122* *1251* *139* to human *0*, and which need not *69* hold for the will of every *2* being; this may *73* *471* us with a maxim, but not with a law; with a *20*ive *1* on which we may have a *873* and *33* to act, but not with an *36*ive *1* on which we *8* be *1238* to act, even *94* all our *586*, *33*s, and *81* *257*s were *584* to it. In fact, the *313* and *218* *115* of the *108* in duty are so much the more *665*, the less the *20*ive *376*s *228* it and the more they *1209* it, *13* being able in the *1202* *211* to *911* the *116* of the law or to *1158* its *144*.

Here then we see *26* *249* to a *254* *547*, since it has to be *954* fixed, *395* that it has *44* to *920* it in *762* or earth. Here it must show its *309* as *117* *247*or of its own laws, not the *1112* of those which are *1031* to it by an *626* sense or who knows what *974* *5*. Al*94* these may be *173* than *44*, yet they can never *973* *1*s *969* by *0*, which must have their *219* *83* a *42* and *972* their *108*ing *374*, *361*ing *77* from the *984* of the law and the due *27* for it, *44* from *33*, or else *985* the man to self-*931* and *955* *986*.

Thus every *41* *588* is not only quite in*127* of being an aid to the *1* of *19*, but is even *795* *988* to the *309* of *57*, for the *139* and *989* worth of an *79* good will *240* just in this, that the *1* of *6* is free from all *95* of *181* *216*, which alone *38* can *382*. We *10* too much or too often *997* our *1003* *357* this lax and even mean habit of *94*t which seeks for its *1* *957* *41* *165*s and laws; for human *0* in its *1006* is glad to rest on this *1012*, and in a dream of sweet *1013* (in which, *391* of Juno, it *1018* a cloud) it *1021* for *19* a *1024* *1030* up from limbs of *951* *1032*, which looks like *75* one *305*s to see in it, only not like *202* to one who has once *1038* her in her true form. *

* To *1039* *202* in her *139* form is *44* else but to *773* *19* *1049* of all *944* of *128* *93* and of every *941* *1067* of *1069* or self-love. How much she then *882* *77* else that *423* *1070* to the *506*ions, every one may *347* *679* with the least *1073* of his *0*, if it be not *83* *1077* for abstr*6*.

The *72* then is this: "Is it a *30* law for all *2* *22* that they *8* *40* judge of their *6*s by *37* of which they can *50* will that they *8* serve as *7* laws?" If it is so, then it must be *276* (*278* a *42*) with the very *18* of the will of a *2* being *47*ly. But in order to *358* this *508* we must, *21* *1078*, take a step into *60*, *31* into a *935* of it which is *239* from *99* *26*, *46*, the *60* of *57*. In a *4* *26*, where it is not the *0*s of what *259*s that we have to as*67*, but the laws of what ought to *259*, even *31* it never does, i.e., *36*ive *4* laws, there it is not *30* to *345* into the *0*s why *75* *622* or dis*622*, how the *251* of mere *320* *653*s from taste, and *25* the *45* is *239* from a *47* satisf*6* of *0*; on what the *97* of *251* or pain rests, and how from it *100* and *33*s arise, and from these again *37* by the co-*606* of *0*: for all this *133* to an *41* *701*, which would *402* the *119* part of *226*, if we *66* *226* as the *26* of *5*, so far as it is based on *41* laws. But here we are *316*ed with *36*ive *4* laws and, *61*, with the *90* of the will to *3* so far as it is *85*d by *0* alone, in which case *92* has *196* to *75* *41* is *69* *632*; since if *0* of *3* alone *85*s the *129* (and it is the *190* of this that we are now *1097*), it must *69* do so a *42*.

The will is *76*d as a *118* of *105* *266* to *6* in *806* with the *18* of *67* laws. And such a *118* can be found only in *2* *22*. Now that which *448* the will as the *36*ive *222* of its self-*155* is the end, and, if this is *466* by *0* alone, it must hold for all *2* *22*. On the other hand, that which *24* *205* the *222* of *190* of the *6* of which the *64* is the end, this is *43* the means. The *20*ive *222* of the *236* is the *148*, the *36*ive *222* of the *80* is the *165*; hence the *239*ion *147* *20*ive ends which rest on *148*s, and *36*ive ends which *293* on *165*s valid for every *2* being. Practical *1*s are *200* when they *344* from all *20*ive ends; they are *329* when they *172* these, and *16* *122* *148*s of *6*. The ends which a *2* being *904*s to *9* at *251* as *64*s of his *6*s (*329* ends) are all only *343*, for it is only their *90* to the *122* *100* of the *20* that gives them their worth, which *16* *10* *382* *1*s *7* and *30* for all *2* *22* and for every *80*, that is to say *4* laws. Hence all these *343* ends can give rise only to *162* *12*s.

Supposing, *21*, that there were *53* whose *206* has in *3* an *117* worth, *53* which, being an end in *3*, could be a *219* of *178* laws; then in this and this alone would lie the *219* of a *11* *35* *12*, i.e., a *4* law.

Now I say: man and *47*ly any *2* being *480* as an end in *9*, not *24* as a means to be *1106* used by this or that will, but in all his *6*s, *25* they *316* *9* or other *2* *22*, must be *40* *66*ed at the same time as an end. All *36*s of the *33*s have only a *34*al worth, for if the *33*s and the wants *314* on them did not exist, then their *36* would be *13* value. But the *33*s, *50* being *219*s of want, are so far from *775* an *117* worth for which they *8* be *236*d that on the *88* it must be the *7* wish of every *2* being to be *83* free from them. Thus the worth of any *36* which is to be *928* by our *6* is *40* *34*al. Beings whose *206* *293*s not on our will but on *5*'s, have *179*, if they are ir*2* *22*, only a *343* value as means, and are *16* *43* *93*; *2* *22*, on the *88*, are *43* *141*s, *23* their very *5* *484* them out as ends in *50*, that is as *53* which must not be used *24* as means, and so far *16* re*258*s *14* of *6* (and is an *36* of *27*). These, *16*, are not *24* *20*ive ends whose *206* has a worth for us as an *64* of our *6*, but *36*ive ends, that is, *93* whose *206* is an end in *3*; an end *303* for which no other can be *1114*, which they *8* *863* *24* as means, for *106* *44* *92* would *491* *117* worth; but if all worth were *34*ed and *16* *181*, then there would be no *63* *4* *1* of *0* *92*.

If then there is a *63* *4* *1* or, in *27* of the human will, a *35* *12*, it must be one which, being drawn from the *18* of that which is *69* an end for *232* *23* it is an end in *3*, *208* an *36*ive *1* of will, and can *16* serve as a *7* *4* law. The *170* of this *1* is: *2* *5* *480* as an end in *3*. Man *69* *76*s his own *206* as being so; so far then this is a *20*ive *1* of human *6*s. But every other *2* being *66*s its *206* *861*, just on the same *2* *1* that holds for me: * so that it is at the same time an *36*ive *1*, from which as a *63* *4* law all laws of the will must be *127* of being *398*. Accordingly the *4* *12* will be as *114*: So act as to treat *110*, *25* in thine own *141* or in that of any other, in every case as an end *1126*, never as means only. We will now *345* *25* this can be *4*ly *1130* out.

* This *98* is here *1133* as a *1143*. The *222* of it will be found in the *495* *151*.

To abide by the *496* *164*s:

Firstly, under the head of *30* duty to *266*: He who *773*s *1146* *8* ask *9* *25* his *6* can be *295* with the idea of *110* as an end in *3*. If he *297*s *9* in order to *367* from *1153* *315*, he uses a *141* *24* as a mean to *318* a *1155* *34* up to the end of life. But a man is not a thing, that is to say, *53* which can be used *24* as means, but must in all his *6*s be *40* *231* as an end in *9*. I *10*, *16*, *1161* in any way of a man in my own *141* so as to *1163* him, to *1166* or kill him. (It *133* to *229* *139* to *696* this *1* more *296*, so as to avoid all mis*39*, e. g., as to the *1173* of the limbs in order to *613* *101*, as to *1174* my life to *1175* with a view to *613* it, etc. This *72* is *16* *1176* here.)

Secondly, as *66*s *30* *91*, or those of *258* *116*, *465* *56*: He who is *595* of *387* a lying *109* to *56* will see at once that he would be using *86* man *24* as a mean, *13* the *45* *281*ing at the same time the end in *9*. For he whom I *904* by such a *109* to use for my own *49*s *10* *213* *763* to my mode of *96* *465* him and, *16*, *10* *9* *281* the end of this *6*. This *1183* of the *1* of *110* in other men is more *1185* if we take in *164*s of *903* on the *14* and *139*ty of *56*. For then it is clear that he who *1188* the *789* of men *1195* to use the *141* of *56* *24* as a means, *13* *255*ing that as *2* *22* they ought *40* to be *408* also as ends, that is, as *22* who must be *127* of *281*ing in *50* the end of the very same *6*. *

* Let it not be *94*t that the *54* "quod tibi non vis fieri, etc." could serve here as the rule or *1*. For it is only a *560* from the *55*, *94* with *1200* l*971*s; it *10* be a *7* law, for it does not *281* the *1* of *91* to *266*, nor of the *91* of *454* to *56* (for many a one would *897* *1203* that *56* *8* not *604* him, *256* only that he might be *523* from *895* *454* to them), nor *592* that of *91* of *258* *116* to one *86*, for on this *1* the *1206* might argue *357* the judge who *1210* him, and so on.

Thirdly, as *66*s *181* (*573*) *91* to *266*: It is not *184* that the *6* does not *827* *110* in our own *141* as an end in *3*, it must also *532* with it. Now there are in *110* *630* of *322* *159*, which *234* to the end that *5* has in view in *66* to *110* in *58* as the *20*: to *589* these might *143* be *295* with the *1213* of *110* as an end in *3*, but not with the *786* of this end.

Fourthly, as *66*s *573* *91* *465* *56*: The *81* end which all men have is their own *32*. Now *110* might *73* *430*, *31* no one *8* *597* *75* to the *32* of *56*, *256* he did not *526*ally *1219* *75* from it; but after all this would only *532* *500*ly not *478*ly with *110* as an end in *3*, if every one does not also *551*, as far as in him lies, to *888* the ends of *56*. For the ends of any *20* which is an end in *9* ought as far as *11* to be my ends also, if that *18* is to have its full *64* with me.

This *1*, that *110* and *47*ly every *2* *5* is an end in *3* (which is the *63* *540* *34* of every man's *14* of *6*), is not *401*ed from *38*, *915*, *23* it is *7*, *1229* as it does to all *2* *22* *92*, and *38* is not *127* of *105* *75* about them; *119*ly, *23* it does not *152* *110* as an end to men (*20*ively), that is as an *36* which men do of *50* *161* adopt as an end; but as an *36*ive end, which must as a law *402* the *63* *540* *34* of all our *20*ive ends, let them be what we will; it must *16* *148* from pure *0*. In fact the *36*ive *1* of all *4* *134* lies (*62* to the first *1*) in the rule and its form of *7*ity which makes it *127* of being a law (say, e. g., a law of *5*); but the *20*ive *1* is in the end; now by the *119* *1* the *20* of all ends is each *2* being, *279* as it is an end in *3*. Hence *114* the third *4* *1* of the will, which is the *735* *34* of its *517* with *7* *4* *0*, viz.: the idea of the will of every *2* being as a *7*ly *405* will.

On this *1* all *37* are *913* which are in*295* with the will being *3* *7* *887*. Thus the will is not *20* *74* to the law, but so *20* that it must be *66*ed as *3* *154* the law and, on this *222* only, *20* to the law (of which it can *66* *3* as the *886*).

In the *496* *12*s, *46*, that based on the *18* of the *183*ity of *6*s to *47* laws, as in a *125* *123* of *5*, and that based on the *7* *885* of *2* *22* as ends in *50*- these *12*s, just *23* they were *76*d as *35*, *632* from any share in their *374* all *944* of any *29* as a *148* of *6*; they were, *21*, only *172*d to be *35*, *23* such an *884* was *30* to *180* the *18* of duty. But we could not prove *163*ly that there are *4* *98*s which *108* *35*ly, nor can it be *880* in this *151*; one thing, *21*, could be done, *46*, to *839* in the *12* *3*, by some *601* *859*ion, that in the case of *80* from duty all *29* is *1240*, which is the *876* *1242* of *35* as *158* from *162* *12*s. This is done in the *152* (third) *191* of the *1*, *46*, in the idea of the will of every *2* being as a *7*ly *261* will.

For *31* a will which is *20* to laws may be *874* to this law by means of an *29*, yet a will which is *3* a *63* *872* so far as it is such *10* *213* *293* on any *29*, since a will so *293*ent would *3* still need *86* law re*258*ing the *29* of its self-love by the *34* that it *8* be valid as *7* law.

Thus the *1* that every human will is a will which in all its *37* gives *7* laws, * *256* it be *106* *842*, would be very well *298* to be the *35* *12*, in this *27*, *46*, that just *23* of the idea of *7* *134* it is not based on *29*, and *16* it alone among all *11* *12*s can be un*34*al. Or still *173*, *1248* the *98*, if there is a *35* *12* (i.e., a law for the will of every *2* being), it can only *108* that *77* be done from *37* of one's will *66*ed as a will which could at the same time will that it *8* *3* give *7* laws, for in that case only the *4* *1* and the *12* which it obeys are un*34*al, since they *10* be based on any *29*.

* I may be *523* from *1250* *164*s to *869* this *1*, as those which have *145* been used to *869* the *35* *12* and its *191* would all serve for the like *49* here.

Looking back now on all *496* *936* to *358* the *1* of *19*, we need not *1254* why they all *1256*. It was seen that man was bound to laws by duty, but it was not ob*772* that the laws to which he is *20* are only those of his own *154*, *94* at the same time they are *7*, and that he is only bound to act in *183*ity with his own will; a will, *21*, which is *1258* by *5* to give *7* laws. For when one has *76*d man only as *20* to a law (no *171* what), then this law *285*d some *29*, *120* by way of attr*6* or *1261*, since it did not *458*ate as a law from his own will, but this will was *62* to a law *825* by *53* else to act in a *67* *388*. Now by this *30* *221* all the *384* spent in *556* a *63* *1* of duty was *1266* lost. For men never *1271* duty, but only a *28* of *96* from a *67* *29*. Whether this *29* was *325* or *106*, in any case the *12* must be *34*al and could not by any means be *127* of being a moral *108*. I will *16* call this the *1* of *65* of the will, in *799* with every other which I *62*ly *409* as *167*.

The *18* of the will of every *2* being as one which must *255* *3* as *154* in all the *37* of its will *7* laws, so as to judge *3* and its *6*s from this point of view- this *18* leads to *86* which *293*s on it and is very *857*, *46* that of a *51* of ends.

By a *51* I *389* the union of *103* *2* *22* in a *123* by *54* laws. Now since it is by laws that ends are *85*d as *66*s their *7* *144*, hence, if we *344* from the *141*al *301*s of *2* *22* and *166* from all the *469* of their *325* ends, we shall be able to *76* all ends *378* in a *123*atic whole (*933* both *2* *22* as ends in *50*, and also the *187* ends which each may *904* to *9*), that is to say, we can *76* a *51* of ends, which on the *558* *1*s is *11*.

For all *2* *22* come under the law that each of them must treat *3* and all *56* never *24* as means, but in every case at the same time as ends in *50*. Hence *424*s a *123*atic union of *2* being by *54* *36*ive laws, i.e., a *51* which may be *43* a *51* of ends, since what these laws have in view is just the *90* of these *22* to one *86* as ends and means. It is *67*ly only an ideal.

A *2* being *133* as a *107* to the *51* of ends when, *31* *154* *7* laws in it, he is also *9* *20* to these laws. He *133* to it as *427* when, while *154* laws, he is not *20* to the will of any other.

A *2* being must *40* *66* *9* as *154* laws *120* as *107* or as *427* in a *51* of ends which is *1277* *11* by the *14* of will. He *10*, *21*, *318* the *45* *547* *24* by the *37* of his will, but only in case he is a *227* *163* being *13* wants and with unre*258*ed power *1279* to his will.

Morality *240* then in the *196* of all *6* to the *134* which alone can *1281* a *51* of ends *11*. This *134* must be *127* of *854* in every *2* being and of *1284* from his will, so that the *1* of this will is never to act on any maxim which could not *13* *102* be also a *7* law and, *62*ly, *40* so to act that the will could at the same time *66* *3* as *154* in its *37* *7* laws. If now the *37* of *2* *22* are not by their own *5* *848*nt with this *36*ive *1*, then the *28* of *96* on it is *43* *4* *581*, i.e., duty. Duty does not apply to the *427* in the *51* of ends, but it does to every *107* of it and to all in the same *211*.

The *4* *28* of *96* on this *1*, i.e., duty, does not rest at all on *97*s, *376*s, or *33*s, but *490* on the *90* of *2* *22* to one *86*, a *90* in which the will of a *2* being must *40* be *66*ed as *405*, since *106* it could not be *76*d as an end in *3*. Reason then *784* every maxim of the will, *66*ing it as *261* *7*ly, to every other will and also to every *6* *465* *266*; and this not on *124* of any other *4* *165* or any *352* *186*, but from the idea of the *115* of a *2* being, *852* no law but that which he *9* also gives.

In the *51* of ends *77* has *120* value or *115*. Whatever has a value can be re*562* by *53* else which is *846*; *92*, on the other hand, is above all value, and *16* *628* of no *846*, has a *115*.

Whatever has *196* to the *47* *33*s and wants of *1301* has a *844* value; *92*, *13* pre*590* a want, *1304* to a *67* taste, that is to a satisf*6* in the mere *49*less play of our *369*, has a fancy value; but that which *208* the *34* under which alone *75* can be an end in *3*, this has not *24* a *343* worth, i.e., value, but an *218* worth, that is, *115*.

Now *19* is the *34* under which alone a *2* being can be an end in *9*, since by this alone is it *11* that he *8* be a *261* *107* in the *51* of ends. Thus *19*, and *110* as *127* of it, is that which alone has *115*. Skill and *1306* in *384* have a *844* value; wit, *528* *524*, and *1309*, have fancy value; on the other hand, *1312* to *109*s, *454* from *1* (not from *302*), have an *218* worth. N*120* *5* nor art *205* *75* which in *1314* of these it could put in their place, for their worth *240* not in the *64*s which *148* from them, not in the use and *186* which they *377*, but in the *257* of mind, that is, the *37* of the will which are ready to *1319* *50* in such *6*s, even *94* they *8* not have the *236*d *64*. These *6*s also need no *1320* from any *20*ive taste or *1323*, that they may be *829* on with *292* *228* and satisf*6*: they need no *292* *873* or *97* for them; they *967* the will that *559* them as an *36* of an *292* *27*, and *44* but *0* is *285*d to *538* them on the will; not to f*45* it into them, which, in the case of *91*, would be a *102*. This *914* *16* shows that the worth of such a *257* is *115*, and *828* it *587* above all value, with which it *10* for a *593* be *249* into *514* or *824* *13* as it were *1345* its *1349*.

What then is it which *1350* *202* or the *381* good *257*, in *387* such lofty *299*? It is *44* less than the *822* it *377*s to the *2* being of *603* in the *154* of *7* laws, by which it *749* him to be a *107* of a *11* *51* of ends, a *822* to which he was *145* *1356* by his own *5* as being an end in *9* and, on that *124*, *261* in the *51* of ends; free as *66*s all laws of *125* *5*, and *852* those only which he *9* gives, and by which his *37* can *234* to a *123* of *7* law, to which at the same time he *1357* *9*. For *44* has any worth *214* what the law *515*s it. Now the *134* *3* which *515*s the worth of *77* must for that very *0* *491* *115*, that is an un*34*al *1372* worth; and the word *27* alone *1378* a *1382* *859*ion for the *417* which a *2* being must have for it. Autonomy then is the basis of the *115* of human and of every *2* *5*.

The three modes of *152*ing the *1* of *19* that have been *1389* are at *686* only so many *191*e of the very same law, and each of *3* *323* the other two. There is, *21*, a *301* in them, but it is *140* *20*ively than *36*ively *4*, *472* *46* to bring an idea of the *0* *360* to *359* (by means of a *67* *443*) and *112* *360* to *97*. All *37*, in fact, have:

1. A form, *804* in *7*ity; and in this view the *191* of the moral *12* is *286* thus, that the *37* must be so *788* as if they were to serve as *7* laws of *5*.

2. A *171*, *46*, an end, and here the *191* says that the *2* being, as it is an end by its own *5* and *16* an end in *3*, must in every maxim serve as the *34* *540* all *24* *343* and *437* ends.

3. A *243* *284*ization of all *37* by means of that *191*, *46*, that all *37* ought by their own *134* to *532* with a *11* *51* of ends as with a *51* of *5*. * There is a *1392* here in the order of the *1393* of unity of the form of the will (its *7*ity), *1394* of the *171* (the *36*s, i.e., the ends), and *695* of the *123* of these. In *1395* our moral *89* of *6*s, it is *173* to *1397* *40* on the *258* *449* and start from the *47* *191* of the *35* *12*: Act *62* to a maxim which can at the same time make *3* a *7* law. If, *21*, we wish to gain an *1398* for the moral law, it is very *283* to bring one and the same *6* under the three *1399* *18*s, and *112* as far as *11* to bring it *360* to *359*.

* Teleology *255*s *5* as a *51* of ends; *229* *66*s a *11* *51* of ends as a *51* *5*. In the first case, the *51* of ends is a *338* idea, *337* to *180* what *161* is. In the *45* it is a *4* idea, *337* to bring about that which is not yet, but which can be *803* by our *129*, *46*, if it *183*s to this idea.

We can now end where we *1413* at the *1414*, *46*, with the *18* of a will un*34*ally good. That will is *79* good which *10* be evil- in other words, whose maxim, if made a *7* law, could never *224* *3*. This *1*, then, is its *63* law: "Act *40* on such a maxim as thou canst at the same time will to be a *7* law"; this is the sole *34* under which a will can never *224* *3*; and such an *12* is *35*. Since the *144* of the will as a *7* law for *11* *6*s is *889* to the *7* *508* of the *206* of *93* by *47* laws, which is the *200* *82* of *5* in *47*, the *35* *12* can also be *286* thus: Act on *37* which can at the same time have for their *36* *50* as *7* laws of *5*. Such then is the *191* of an *79* good will.

Rational *5* is *158* from the rest of *5* by this, that it sets *230* *3* an end. This end would be the *171* of every good will. But since in the idea of a will that is *79* good *13* being *764* by any *34* (of *253*ing this or that end) we must *344* *83* from every end to be *64*ed (since this would make every will only *343*ly good), it *114* that in this case the end must be *76*d, not as an end to be *64*ed, but as an *163*ly *854* end. Consequently it is *76*d only *500*ly, i.e., as that which we must never act *357* and which, *16*, must never be *66*ed *24* as means, but must in every *80* be *408* as an end *166*. Now this end can be *44* but the *20* of all *11* ends, since this is also the *20* of a *11* *79* good will; for such a will *10* *13* *102* be *474* to any other *36*. The *1*: "So act in *66* to every *2* being (*1430* and *56*), that he may *40* have place in thy maxim as an end in *9*," is *62*ly *444*ly *797* with this other: "Act upon a maxim which, at the same time, *323* its own *7* *144* for every *2* being." For that in using means for every end I *8* limit my maxim by the *34* of its *1433* good as a law for every *20*, this comes to the same thing as that the *289* *1* of all *37* of *6* must be that the *20* of all ends, i.e., the *2* being *9*, be never *380* *24* as means, but as the *63* *34* re*258*ing the use of all means, that is in every case as an end *166*.

It *114* *1438* that, to *92* laws any *2* being may be *20*, he being an end in *9* must be able to *66* *9* as also *261* *7*ly in *27* of these same laws, since it is just this *518* of his *37* for *7* *134* that *272*es him as an end in *9*; also it *114* that this *364* his *115* (*885*) above all mere *125* *22*, that he must *40* take his *37* from the point of view which *66*s *9* and, *166*, every other *2* being as law-*154* *22* (on which *124* they are *43* *141*s). In this way a world of *2* *22* (*1439* *1442*) is *11* as a *51* of ends, and this by *202* of the *134* *139* to all *141*s as *107*s. Therefore every *2* being must so act as if he were by his *37* in every case a *261* *107* in the *7* *51* of ends. The *200* *1* of these *37* is: "So act as if thy maxim were to serve *166* as the *7* law (of all *2* *22*)." A *51* of ends is thus only *11* on the *443* of a *51* of *5*, the *55* *21* only by *37*, that is self-*533* rules, the *45* only by the laws of *242* *146* *96* under *581* from *13*. Nevertheless, *31* the *123* of *5* is *829* upon as a *1444*, yet so far as it has *196* to *2* *22* as its ends, it is given on this *124* the name of a *51* of *5*. Now such a *51* of ends would be *161* *803* by means of *37* *183*ing to the canon which the *35* *12* *945* to all *2* *22*, if they were *7*ly *419*ed. But *31* a *2* being, even if he *1448* *114* this maxim *9*, *10* *409* upon all *56* being *16* true to the same, nor *361* that the *51* of *5* and its *1450* *1453* shall be in *517* with him as a *1455* *107*, so as to form a *51* of ends to which he *9* *597*s, that is to say, that it shall *228* his *361*ation of *32*, still that law: "Act *62* to the *37* of a *107* of a *24* *11* *51* of ends *261* in it *7*ly," *136* in its full force, *279* as it *108*s *35*ly. And it is just in this that the *1458* lies; that the mere *115* of man as a *2* *386*, *13* any other end or *186* to be *252* *112*, in other words, *27* for a mere idea, *8* yet serve as an *836* *177* of the will, and that it is *296* in this in*293*ence of the maxim on all such *148*s of *6* that its *313* *240*; and it is this that makes every *2* *20* *271* to be a *405* *107* in the *51* of ends: for *106* he would have to be *76*d only as *20* to the *125* law of his wants. And *31* we *8* *201* the *51* of *5* and the *51* of ends to be *782* under one *427*, so that the *45* *51* *112* *1461* to be a mere idea and *928* true *185*, then it would no doubt gain the *1462* of a *611* *148*, but by no means any *958* of its *218* worth. For this sole *117* *872* must, *395* this, be *40* *76*d as *509* the worth of *2* *22* only by their dis*29*ed *1464*, as *456* to *50* from that idea [the *115* of man] alone. The *781* of *93* is not *1467* by their *335* *90*s, and that which, abstr*96* from these, alone *208* the *117* worth of man, is also that by which he must be *1482*, *455* the judge may be, and even by the Supreme Being. Morality, then, is the *90* of *6*s to the *90* of *6*s will, that is, to the *65* of *1485* *7* *134* by its *37*. An *6* that is *295* with the *65* of the will is *868*; one that does not agree *1491* is *1492*. A will whose *37* *69* *848* with the laws of *65* is a holy will, good *79*. The *293*ence of a will not *79* good on the *1* of *65* (moral *581*) is *116*. This, then, *10* be *312* to a holy being. The *36*ive *28* of *6*s from *116* is *43* duty.

From what has just been said, it is easy to see how it *259*s that, *31* the *18* of duty *364* *20*ion to the law, we yet *366* a *67* *115* and *313* to the *141* who *1500* all his *91*. There is not, *73*, any *313* in him, so far as he is *20* to the moral law; but *279* as in *66* to that very law he is *166* a *887*, and on that *124* alone *20* to it, he has *313*. We have also shown above that n*120* fear nor *33*, but *74* *27* for the law, is the *148* which can give *6*s a moral worth. Our own will, so far as we *201* it to act only under the *34* that its *37* are *1485*ly *7* laws, this ideal will which is *11* to us is the *139* *36* of *27*; and the *115* of *110* *240* just in this *1502* of being *7*ly *405*, *94* with the *34* that it is *3* *20* to this same *134*.

The Autonomy of the Will as the Supreme Principle of Morality

Autonomy of the will is that *139*ty of it by which it is a law to *3* (*163*ly of any *139*ty of the *36*s of *80*). The *1* of *65* then is: "Always so to *305* that the same *80* shall *451* the *37* of our *365* as a *7* law." We *10* prove that this *4* rule is an *12*, i.e., that the will of every *2* being is *69* bound to it as a *34*, by a mere *356* of the *18*s which occur in it, since it is a *307*al *98*; we must *860* *294* the *596* of the *36*s to a *254* *199* of the *20*, that is, of the pure *4* *0*, for this *307* *98* which *108*s *536*ally must be *127* of being *1508* *83* a *42*. This *171*, *21*, does not *234* to the *152* *151*. But that the *1* of *65* in *72* is the sole *1* of *57* can be *347* shown by mere *356* of the *18*s of *19*. For by this *356* we find that its *1* must be a *35* *12* and that what this *108*s is n*120* more nor less than this very *65*.

Heteronomy of the Will as the Source of all *941* Principles

of Morality

If the will seeks the law which is to *85* it *567* else than in the *518* of its *37* to be *7* laws of its own *771*, *61* if it goes out of *3* and seeks this law in the *284* of any of its *36*s, there *40* *424*s *167*. The will in that case does not give *3* the law, but it is given by the *36* *182* its *90* to the will. This *90*, *25* it rests on *33* or on *18*s of *0*, only *628* of *162* *12*s: "I ought to do *53* *23* I wish for *53* else." On the *88*, the moral, and *16* *35*, *12* says: "I ought to do so and so, even *94* I *8* not wish for *75* else." E.g., the *55* says: "I ought not to lie, if I would *1518* my *1519*"; the *45* says: "I ought not to lie, *31* it *8* not bring me the least dis*510*." The *45* *16* must so far *344* from all *36*s that they shall have no *95* on the will, in order that *4* *0* (will) may not be re*258*ed to *1524* an *29* not *87* to it, but may *74* show its own *108*ing *374* as the *63* *134*. Thus, e.g., I ought to *551* to *432* the *32* of *56*, not as if its *575* *446* any *316* of mine (*25* by *292* *33* or by any satisf*6* in*247*ly *442* *182* *0*), but *74* *23* a maxim which *554* it *10* be *451*ed as a *7* law in one and the same *80*.

Classification of all Principles of Morality which can be

*314* on the Conception of Heteronomy

Here as *902* human *0* in its pure use, so long as it was not *254*ly *699*d, has first tried all *11* wrong ways *230* it *1532* in *556* the one true way.

All *1*s which can be taken from this point of view are *120* *41* or *2*. The *55*, drawn from the *1* of *32*, are built on *125* or moral *97*s; the *45*, drawn from the *1* of *159*, are built *120* on the *2* *18* of *159* as a *11* *64*, or on that of an *163* *159* (the will of God) as the *105* cause of our will.

Empirical *1*s are *83* in*127* of *582* as a *170* for moral laws. For the *7*ity with which these *8* hold for all *2* *22* *13* *239*ion, the un*34*al *4* *28* which is *112* *533* on them, is lost when their *170* is taken from the *122* *225* of human *5*, or the *1191*al *315* in which it is *562*. The *1* of *325* *32*, *21*, is the most *36*ionable, not *24* *23* it is false, and *38* *224*s the sup*547* that *550* is *40* *1246*ed to good *129*, nor yet *24* *23* it *597*s *44* to the *475* of *19*- since it is quite a *103* thing to make a *1552* man and a good man, or to make one *350* and sharp-*723* for his own *29*s and to make him *919*- but *23* the *148*s it *794*s for *19* are such as *140* *1560* it and *297* its *313*, since they put the *165*s to *202* and to vice in the same class and only teach us to make a *173* *441*, the *876* *301* *147* *202* and vice being *375* *1566*. On the other hand, as to moral *97*, this *169* *187* sense, * the *1567* to it is *73* *1568* when those who *10* think *620* that *97* will help them out, even in what *316*s *47* laws: and *277*, *97*s, which *81*ly *653* *587* in *211*, *10* *382* a *1570* *493* of good and evil, nor has *1571* a right to form *89*s for *56* by his own *97*s: *179* this moral *97* is *360* to *19* and its *115* in this *27*, that it pays *202* the *545* of *1572* to her *267* the satisf*6* and *417* we have for her and does not, as it were, tell her to her face that we are not *874* to her by her *1574* but by *563*.

* I class the *1* of moral *97* under that of *32*, *23* every *41* *29* *109*s to *597* to our well-being by the *865* that a thing *973*s, *25* it be *267* and *13* a view to *563*, or *25* *563* be *66*ed. We must *166*, with Hutcheson, class the *1* of *260* with the *32* of *56* under his *172*d moral sense.

Amongst the *2* *1*s of *19*, the onto*685* *18* of *159*, *395* its *1592*, is *173* than the theo*685* *18* which *468*s *19* from a Divine *79* *330* will. The *55* is, no doubt, empty and in*178* and *61* *1596* for *556* in the *1599* field of *11* *185* the *197* *708* *619* for us; *303*, in *1600* to *272* *876*ally the *185* of which we are now *460* from every other, it *420* tends to turn in a *421* and *10* avoid *1601* pre*590* the *19* which it is to *180*; it is *179* *1602* to the theo*685* view, first, *23* we have no *359* of the *396* *159* and can only *664* it from our own *18*s, the most *614*ant of which is that of *19*, and our *326* would thus be *446* in a gross *421*; and, in the next place, if we avoid this, the only *82* of the Divine will *392*ing to us is a *18* made up of the *499*s of *236* of glory and *1610*, *378* with the awful *18*s of might and *1612*, and any *123* of *57* *1614* on this *170* would be *247*ly *584* to *19*.

However, if I had to *305* *147* the *82* of the moral sense and that of *159* in *47* (two *123*s which at least do not *911* *19*, *31* they are *1617* in*127* of *582* as its *170*), then I *8* *742* for the *45*, *23* it at least *1219*s the *916* of the *72* from the *149* and *1625* it to the court of pure *0*; and *31* even here it *742*s *44*, it at all *792* pre*448* the in*178* idea (of a will good in *3* free from *535*, until it shall be more *296* *696*d.

For the rest I think I may be *523* here from a *1627* *1628* of all these *640*; that would only be *1629* *384*, since it is so easy, and is *738* so well seen even by those whose *1634* *210* them to *742* for one of these *1635* (*23* their *1636* would not *1637* *1638* of *89*). But what *29*s us more here is to know that the prime *170* of *19* laid down by all these *1*s is *44* but *167* of the will, and for this *0* they must *69* miss their aim.

In every case where an *36* of the will has to be *169*, in order that the rule may be *456* which is to *85* the will, there the rule is *74* *167*; the *12* is *34*al, *46*, if or *23* one *235* for this *36*, one *8* act so and so: hence it can never *108* *381*, that is, *35*ly. Whether the *36* *85*s the will by means of *33*, as in the *1* of *325* *32*, or by means of *0* *247*ed to *36*s of our *11* *80* *47*ly, as in the *1* of *159*, in *120* case the will never *85*s *3* *267* by the *18* of the *6*, but only by the *95* which the *899* *64* of the *6* has on the will; I ought to do *53*, on this *124*, *23* I wish for *53* else; and here there must be yet *86* law *172*d in me as its *20*, by which I *69* will this other thing, and this law again *210* an *12* to re*258* this maxim. For the *95* which the *18* of an *36* *308* the reach of our *369* can *406* on the will of the *20*, in *221* of its *81* *139*ties, *293*s on the *5* of the *20*, *120* the *149* (*33* and taste), or the *39* and *0*, the *385* of which is by the *737* *225* of their *5* *943*ed with satisf*6*. It *114* that the law would be, *121* *460*, given by *5*, and, as such, it must be known and *880* by *38* and would *61* be *181* and *16* in*127* of being an *536* *4* rule, such as the moral rule must be. Not only so, but it is *420* only *167*; the will does not give *3* the law, but is given by a *270* *376* by means of a *122* *81* *225* of the *20* *298* to *728* it. An *79* good will, then, the *1* of which must be a *35* *12*, will be in*601* as *66*s all *36*s and will *281* *24* the form of *80* *47*ly, and that as *65*, that is to say, the cap*1456* of the *37* of every good will to make *50* a *7* law, is *3* the only law which the will of every *2* being *538*s on *3*, *13* *1650* to *172* any *148* or *29* as a *170*.

How such a *307*al *4* a *42* *98* is *11*, and why it is *30*, is a *331* whose *546* does not lie *308* the *370* of the *60* of *57*; and we have not here *1651* its truth, much less *1652* to have a proof of it in our power. We *74* *1653* by the *1436*ment of the *7*ly *728*d *82* of *19* that an *65* of the will is *420* *276* with it, or *140* is its *170*. Whoever then holds *19* to be *75* real, and not a *894* idea *13* any truth, must *166* admit the *1* of it that is here *466*. This *151* then, like the first, was *24* *327*. Now to prove that *19* is no *1659* of the brain, which it *10* be if the *35* *12* and with it the *65* of the will is true, and as an a *42* *1* *79* *30*, this *201*s the *190* of a *307* use of pure *4* *0*, which *21* we *10* *1660* on *13* first *154* a *254* *199* of this *118* of *0*. In the *495* *151* we shall give the *1661* *1664* of this *254* *199* as far as is *355* for our *49*.

SEC_3

THIRD SECTION

TRANSITION FROM THE METAPHYSIC OF MORALS TO THE

CRITIQUE OF PURE PRACTICAL REASON

The Concept of Freedom is the Key that *180*s the Autonomy of the Will

The will is a kind of *70* *87* to *1675* *22* in so far as they are *2*, and *14* would be this *139*ty of such *70* that it can be *242*, *163*ly of *270* *146* *105* it; just as *125* *28* is the *139*ty that the *70* of all ir*2* *22* has of being *85*d to *349* by the *95* of *270* *146*.

The *558* *1678* of *14* is *500* and *16* un*857* for the *358*y of its *781*, but it leads to a *478* *18* which is so much the more full and *857*.

Since the *18* of *70* *323* that of laws, *62* to which, by *53* that we call cause, *53* else, *46* the *64*, must be *203*d; hence, *31* *14* is not a *139*ty of the will *293*ing on *125* laws, yet it is not for that *0* *1683*; on the *88* it must be a *70* *96* *62* to *1686* laws, but of a *737* kind; *106* a free will would be an *1029*ity. Physical *28* is a *167* of the *242* *146*, for every *64* is *11* only *62* to this law, that *53* else *85*s the *242* cause to exert its *70*. What else then can *14* of the will be but *65*, that is, the *139*ty of the will to be a law to *3*? But the *98*: "The will is in every *6* a law to *3*," only *438* the *1*: "To act on no other maxim than that which can also have as an *36* *3* as a *7* law." Now this is *296* the *191* of the *35* *12* and is the *1* of *19*, so that a free will and a will *20* to moral laws are one and the same.

On the *237*, then, of *14* of the will, *19* *397* with its *1* *114* from it by mere *356* of the *18*. However, the *45* is a *307* *98*; viz., an *79* good will is that whose maxim can *40* *1691* *3* *66*ed as a *7* law; for this *139*ty of its maxim can never be *358*ed by *1693* the *18* of an *79* good will. Now such *307* *98*s are only *11* in this way: that the two *596*s are *276* *397* by their union with a third in which they are both to be found. The *478* *195* of *14* *382*es this third *596*, which *10*, as with *125* *146*, be the *5* of the *128* world (in the *195* of which we find *717* the *195* of *53* in *90* as cause to *53* else as *64*). We *10* now at once show what this third is to which *14* *484* us and of which we have an idea a *42*, nor can we make *168* how the *195* of *14* is shown to be *715* from *1*s of pure *4* *0* and with it the *190* of a *35* *12*; but some *137* *1705* is *285*d.

Freedom must be pre*169* as a Property of the Will

of all Rational Beings

It is not *184* to *1706* *14* of our own will, from Whatever *0*, if we have not *355* *216* for *1707* the same of all *2* *22*. For as *19* *448* as a law for us only *23* we are *2* *22*, it must also hold for all *2* *22*; and as it must be *398* *74* from the *139*ty of *14*, it must be shown that *14* also is a *139*ty of all *2* *22*. It is not *184*, then, to prove it from *67* *169* *38*s of human *5* (which *73* is quite im*11*, and it can only be shown a *42*), but we must show that it *133* to the *349* of all *2* *22* *341* with a will. Now I say every being that *10* act *214* under the idea of *14* is just for that *0* in a *4* point of view *156* free, that is to say, all laws which are *539* *276* with *14* have the same force for him as if his will had been shown to be free in *3* by a proof *338*ly *1710*. * Now I *1712* that we must *499* to every *2* being which has a will that it has also the idea of *14* and acts *375* under this idea. For in such a being we *76* a *0* that is *4*, that is, has *70* in *196* to its *36*s. Now we *10* *213* *76* a *0* *362*ly *1714* a bias from any other *891* with *27* to its *89*s, for then the *20* would *366* the *155* of its *89* not to its own *0*, but to an *376*. It must *66* *3* as the *886* of its *1*s *163* of *270* *95*s. Consequently as *4* *0* or as the will of a *2* being it must *66* *3* as free, that is to say, the will of such a being *10* be a will of its own *214* under the idea of *14*. This idea must *16* in a *4* point of view be *366*d to every *2* being.

* I adopt this *449* of *530* *14* *24* as an idea which *2* *22* *201* in their *6*s, in order to avoid the *28* of *1717* it in its *338* *892* also. The *55* is *355* for my *49*; for even *94* the *99* proof *8* not be made out, yet a being that *10* act *214* with the idea of *14* is bound by the same laws that would *1718* a being who was *161* free. Thus we can *367* here from the onus which *1719* on the *712*.

Of the Interest *1721* to the Ideas of Morality

We have *592* *354*d the *178* *18* of *19* to the idea of *14*. This *45*, *21*, we could not prove to be *161* a *139*ty of *58* or of human *5*; only we saw that it must be pre*169* if we would *76* a being as *2* and *362* of its *70* in *27* of its *6*s, i.e., as *341* with a will; and so we find that on just the same *216* we must *366* to every being *341* with *0* and will this *499* of *105* *3* to *6* under the idea of its *14*.

Now it *424*ed also from the presup*547* of these ideas that we *1728* aware of a law that the *20*ive *1*s of *6*, i.e., *37*, must *40* be so *172*d that they can also hold as *36*ive, that is, *7* *1*s, and so serve as *7* laws of our own *771*. But why then *8* I *20* *101* to this *1* and that *74* as a *2* being, thus also *20*ing to it all other being *341* with *0*? I will allow that no *29* urges me to this, for that would not give a *35* *12*, but I must take an *29* in it and *223* how this comes to pass; for this *121* an "I ought" is *121* an "I would," valid for every *2* being, *256* only that *0* *85*d his *6*s *13* any *1732*. But for *22* that are in *616* *192* as we are by *148*s of a *103* kind, *46*, *149*, and in whose case that is not *40* done which *0* alone would do, for these that *28* is *286* only as an "ought," and the *20*ive *28* is *103* from the *36*ive.

It seems then as if the moral law, that is, the *1* of *65* of the will, were *121* *460* only pre*169* in the idea of *14*, and as if we could not prove its *185* and *36*ive *28* *163*ly. In that case we *8* still have *442* *53* *255*able by at least *105* the true *1* more *607* than had *496*ly been done; but as *66*s its *144* and the *4* *28* of *20*ing *266* to it, we *8* not have *849* a step. For if we were asked why the *7* *144* of our maxim as a law must be the *34* re*258*ing our *6*s, and on what we *222* the worth which we *515* to this *388* of *96*- a worth so great that there *10* be any *570* *29*; and if we were asked *137* how it *259*s that it is by this alone a man *620*s he feels his own *141*al worth, in *514* with which that of an *1739* or dis*1739* *34* is to be *66*ed as *44*, to these *72*s we could give no *1744* *502*.

We find *73* *412* that we can take an *29* in a *141*al *700* which does not *625* any *29* of *335* *34*, *256* this *700* makes us *127* of *603* in the *34* in case *0* were to *64* the *1749*; that is to say, the mere being *271* of *32* can *29* of *3* even *13* the *165* of *603* in this *32*. This *89*, *21*, is in fact only the *64* of the *311* of the moral law which we *230* pre*169* (when by the idea of *14* we *691* *58* from every *41* *29*); but that we ought to *691* *58* from these *29*s, i.e., to *255* *58* as free in *6* and yet as *20* to *67* laws, so as to find a worth *74* in our own *141* which can *1755* us for the loss of *77* that gives worth to our *34*; this we are not yet able to *223* in this way, nor do we see how it is *11* so to act- in other words, *598* the moral law *468*s its *116*.

It must be *690* *631* that there is a sort of *421* here from which it seems im*11* to *367*. In the order of *242* *146* we *172* *58* free, in order that in the order of ends we may *76* *58* as *20* to moral laws: and we *689* *76* *58* as *20* to these laws, *23* we have *499*d to *58* *14* of will: for *14* and self-*134* of will are both *65* and, *16*, are *1759* *18*s, and for this very *0* one must not be used to *180* the other or give the *0* of it, but at most only *685* *49*s to *354* *503*ly *103* *82*s of the same *36* to one *290* *195* (as we *354* *103* fr*6*s of the same value to the *1774* terms).

One re*219* *136* to us, *46*, to *345* *25* we do not *1777* *103* *484* of view when by means of *14* we think *58* as *146* *242* a *42*, and when we form our *18* of *58* from our *6*s as *64*s which we see *230* our eyes.

It is a *682* which needs no *498* *1780* to make, but which we may *172* that even the *54*est *39* can make, *31* it be after its *934* by an *549* *223*ment of *89* which it calls *97*, that all the "ideas" that come to us *681* (as those of the *282*) do not *428* us to know *36*s *106* than as they *506* us; so that what they may be in *50* *136* *651* to us, and *61* that as *66*s "ideas" of this kind even with the *1783* *429* and *1784* that the *39* can apply to them, we can by them only *253* to the *52* of *233*s, never to that of *93* in *50*. As soon as this *239*ion has once been made (*143* *24* in *221* of the *301* ob*772* *147* the ideas given us from *13*, and in which we are *678*, and those that we *203* *74* from *58*, and in which we show our own *349*), then it *114* of *3* that we must admit and *172* *306* the *233* *53* else that is not an *233*, *46*, the *93* in *50*; *31* we must admit that as they can never be known to us *214* as they *506* us, we can come no *360* to them, nor can we ever know what they are in *50*. This must *382* a *239*ion, *21* crude, *147* a world of sense and the world of *39*, of which the *55* may be *103* *62* to the *301* of the *1787* *677* in *951* *1008*s, while the *119* which is its basis *40* *136* the same, Even as to *9*, a man *10* *529* to know what he is in *9* from the *52* he has by *641* *320*. For as he does not as it were *1790* *9*, and does not come by the *18* of *9* a *42* but *41*ly, it *81*ly *114* that he can *676* his *52* even of *9* only by the inner sense and, *61*, only *182* the *233*s of his *5* and the way in which his *174* is *192*. At the same time *294* these *284*istics of his own *20*, made up of mere *233*s, he must *69* *201* *53* else as their basis, *46*, his ego, *92* its *284*istics in *3* may be. Thus in *27* to mere *1793* and *1794* of *320*s he must *409* *9* as *87* to the world of sense; but in *27* of *92* there may be of pure *349* in him (that which *1796* *174* *267* and not *182* *506*ing the *282*), he must *409* *9* as *87* to the *1799* world, of which, *21*, he has no *137* *52*. To such a *1803* the *1804* man must come with *27* to all the *93* which can be *152*ed to him: it is *738* to be met with even in *141*s of the *54*est *39*, who, as is well known, are very much *1805* to *201* *306* the *36*s of the *282* *53* else *671* and *96* of *3*. They spoil it, *21*, by *152*ly *1807* this *671* again; that is to say, *1812* to make it an *36* of *359*, so that they do not *126* a whit the wiser.

Now man *156* finds in *9* a *118* by which he *272*es *9* from *77* else, even from *9* as *192* by *36*s, and that is *0*. This being pure *542* is even *1814* above the *39*. For *31* the *45* is a *542* and does not, like sense, *24* *281* *359*s that arise when we are *192* by *93* (and are *16* *678*), yet it *10* *203* from its *349* any other *18*s than those which *24* serve to bring the *359*s of sense under rules and, *112*, to unite them in one *174*, and *13* this use of the *149* it could not think at all; *248*, on the *88*, *0* shows so pure a *542* in the case of what I call ideas [ideal *18*s] that it *112* far *1815* *77* that the *149* can give it, and *732* its most *614*ant *1816* in *272*ing the world of sense from that of *39*, and *112* *1818* the *416* of the *39* *3*.

For this *0* a *2* being must *66* *9* qua *130* (not from the side of his lower *369*) as *87* not to the world of sense, but to that of *39*; hence he has two *484* of view from which he can *66* *9*, and *265* laws of the *406* of his *369*, and *61* of all his *6*s: first, so far as he *133* to the world of sense, he finds *9* *20* to laws of *5* (*167*); *119*ly, as *87* to the *168* world, under laws which being *163* of *5* have their *170* not in *38* but in *0* alone.

As a *2* being, and *61* *87* to the *168* world, man can never *76* the *70* of his own will *106* than on *34* of the idea of *14*, for in*293*ence of the *601* *146* of the *128* world (an in*293*ence which *0* must *40* *366* to *3*) is *14*. Now the idea of *14* is *539* *276* with the *18* of *65*, and this again with the *7* *1* of *19* which is *1819* the *170* of all *6*s of *2* *22*, just as the law of *5* is of all *415*.

Now the *767* is *650*d which we *826* above, that there was a *1821* *421* *446* in our *0*ing from *14* to *65*, and from this to the moral law, viz.: that we laid down the idea of *14* *23* of the moral law only that we might *689* in turn infer the *45* from *14*, and that *61* we could *515* no *0* at all for this law, but could only [*152*] it as a *1823* *1824* which well *1161*d minds would *897* *1826* to us, but which we could never put *888* as a *1827* *98*. For now we see that, when we *76* *58* as free, we *1828* *58* into the world of *39* as *107*s of it and *265* the *65* of the will with its *221*, *19*; *248*, if we *76* *58* as under *116*, we *255* *58* as *87* to the world of sense and at the same time to the world of *39*.

How is a Categorical Imperative Possible?

Every *2* being *409*s *9* qua *130* as *87* to the world of *39*, and it is *74* as an *242* cause *87* to that world that he calls his *70* a will. On the other side he is also *362* of *9* as a part of the world of sense in which his *6*s, which are mere *233*s [*415*] of that *70*, are *1829*; we *10*, *21*, *223* how they are *11* from this *70* which we do not know; but *391* of that, these *6*s as *87* to the *128* world must be *666* as *85*d by other *415*, *46*, *100* and *33*s. If *16* I were only a *107* of the world of *39*, then all my *6*s would *330*ly *183* to the *1* of *65* of the pure will; if I were only a part of the world of sense, they would *69* be *172*d to *183* *83* to the *81* law of *100* and *33*s, in other words, to the *167* of *5*. (The *55* would rest on *19* as the *63* *1*, the *45* on *32*.) Since, *21*, the world of *39* *205* the *170* of the world of sense, and *61* of its laws also, and *62*ly gives the law to my will (which *133* *83* to the world of *39*) *247*ly, and must be *76*d as doing so, it *114* that, *31* on the one side I must *66* *101* as a being *87* to the world of sense, yet on the other side I must *1831* *101* as *20* as an *130* to the law of the world of *39*, i.e., to *0*, which *205* this law in the idea of *14*, and *16* as *20* to the *65* of the will: *61* I must *66* the laws of the world of *39* as *12*s for me and the *6*s which *183* to them as *91*.

And thus what makes *35* *12*s *11* is this, that the idea of *14* makes me a *107* of an *168* world, in *221* of which, if I were *44* else, all my *6*s would *40* *183* to the *65* of the will; but as I at the same time *1833* *101* as a *107* of the world of sense, they ought so to *183*, and this *35* "ought" *364* a *307* a *42* *98*, *279* as *277* my will as *192* by *128* *100* there is added *137* the idea of the same will but as *87* to the world of the *39*, pure and *4* of *3*, which *205* the *63* *34* *62* to *0* of the *55* will; *296* as to the *359*s of sense there are added *195*s of the *39* which of *50* *1834* *44* but *1835* form in *47* and in this way *307* a *42* *98*s *126* *11*, on which all *52* of *125* *5* rests.

The *4* use of *54* human *0* *1836* this *0*ing. There is no one, not even the most *1837* *753*, *256* only that he is *106* *1838* to the use of *0*, who, when we set *230* him *164*s of *470* of *49*, of *1230*ness in *419*ing good *37*, of *260* and *47* *454* (even *378* with great *1034*s of *186*s and *1843*), does not wish that he might also *491* these *433*. Only on *124* of his *33*s and *376*s he *10* *253* this in *9*, but at the same time he *235* to be free from such *33*s which are *1846* to *9*. He *568* by this that he *661* *9* in *94*t with a will free from the *376*s of the *149* into an order of *93* *83* *103* from that of his *100* in the field of the *149*; since he *10* *361* to *676* by that wish any *1848* of his *100*, nor any *547* which would *612* any of his *373* or *1853* *33*s (for this would *297* the pre-*1854* of the very idea which *1855* that wish from him): he can only *361* a *322* *218* worth of his own *141*. This *173* *141*, *21*, he *1226*s *9* to be when be *661* *9* to the point of view of a *107* of the world of the *39*, to which he is *681* *488* by the idea of *14*, i.e., of in*293*ence on *105* *146* of the world of sense; and from this point of view he is *362* of a good will, which by his own *1488*ion *208* the law for the bad will that he *491*es as a *107* of the world of sense- a law whose *374* he *790* while *1862* it. What he *381* "ought" is then what he *69* "would," as a *107* of the world of the *39*, and is *76*d by him as an "ought" only *279* as he *166* *255*s *9* as a *107* of the world of sense.

Of the Extreme Limits of all Practical Philosophy.

All men *499* to *50* *14* of will. Hence come all *89*s upon *6*s as being such as ought to have been done, *31* they have not been done. However, this *14* is not a *18* of *38*, nor can it be so, since it still *136*, even *94* *38* shows the *88* of what on sup*547* of *14* are *76*d as its *30* *221*s. On the other side it is *394* *30* that *77* that takes place *8* be *1865* *85*d *62* to laws of *5*. This *28* of *5* is *166* not an *41* *18*, just for this *0*, that it *323* the *1867* of *28* and *61* of a *42* *596*. But this *18* of a *123* of *5* is *730* by *38*; and it must even be *420* pre*169* if *38* *3* is to be *11*, that is, a *276* *52* of the *36*s of sense *698* on *47* laws. Therefore *14* is only an idea of *0*, and its *36*ive *185* in *3* is *946*; while *5* is a *195* of the *39* which *568*, and must *69* prove, its *185* in *164*s of *38*.

There *268* from this a *932* of *0*, since the *14* *499*d to the will *423* to *224* the *28* of *5*, and *562* *147* these two ways *0* for *99* *49*s finds the road of *125* *28* much more *1869* and more *1875* than that of *14*; yet for *4* *49*s the *1877* *1879* of *14* is the only one on which it is *11* to make use of *0* in our *129*; hence it is just as im*11* for the *498*st *26* as for the *54*est *0* of men to argue away *14*. Philosophy must then *172* that no real *102* will be found *147* *14* and *125* *28* of the same human *6*s, for it *10* give up the *18* of *5* any more than that of *14*.

Nevertheless, even *94* we *8* never be able to *451* how *14* is *11*, we must at least *650* this *503* *102* in a *896* *388*. For if the *94*t of *14* *224*s *120* *3* or *5*, which is *394* *30*, it must in *824* with *125* *28* be *375* given up.

It would, *21*, be im*11* to *367* this *102* if the *595* *20*, which seems to *3* free, *76*d *3* in the same sense or in the very same *90* when it calls *3* free as when in *27* of the same *6* it *172*s *3* to be *20* to the law of *5*. Hence it is an *418* *331* of *99* *26* to show that its *1889* *27*ing the *102* rests on this, that we think of man in a *103* sense and *90* when we call him free and when we *66* him as *20* to the laws of *5* as being part and *1892* of *5*. It must *16* show that not only can both these very well co-exist, but that both must be *94*t as *69* *782* in the same *20*, since *106* no *0* could be given why we *8* *1893* *0* with an idea which, *94* it may *213* *13* *102* be *1894* with *86* that is *355*ly *436*, yet *647* us in a *939* which *1897* *1899* *0* in its *497* *385*. This duty, *21*, *133* only to *99* *26*. The *476* then has no *1900* *25* he will *650* the *503* *102* or leave it un*1354*; for in the *45* case the *712* *27*ing this would be bonum *1902*, into the *410* of which the *1903* would have a right to enter and chase all *19* out of its *169* *935* as *1777*ing it *13* title.

We *10* *21* as yet say that we are *1906* the *370* of *4* *26*. For the *1907* of that *1908* does not *234* to it; it only *654*s from *99* *0* that it *8* put an end to the *1910* in which it *647* *3* in *338* *72*s, so that *4* *0* may have rest and *1911* from *335* *903* which might make the *222* *1912* on which it *100* to build.

The *299* to *14* of will made even by *54* *0* are *314* on the *174* and the *631* sup*547* that *0* is *163* of *24* *20*ively *85*d *146* which *397* *402* what *133* to *320* only and which *61* come under the *47* *924* of *149*. Man *255*ing *9* in this way as an *130* *828* *9* *112* in a *103* order of *93* and in a *90* to *105* *216* of a *83* *103* kind when on the one hand he *479* of *9* as an *130* *341* with a will, and *61* with *70*, and when on the other he *679*s *9* as a *1915* in the world of sense (as he *156* is also), and *1712*s that his *70* is *20* to *335* *155* *62* to laws of *5*. Now he soon *126*s aware that both can hold good, nay, must hold good at the same time. For there is not the *929* *102* in *1917* that a thing in *233* (*87* to the world of sense) is *20* to *67* laws, of which the very same as a thing or being in *3* is *163*, and that he must *76* and think of *9* in this *599* way, rests as to the first on the *174* of *9* as an *36* *192* *182* the *282*, and as to the *119* on the *174* of *9* as an *130*, i.e., as *163* on *128* *677* in the *385* of his *0* (in other words as *87* to the world of *39*).

Hence it comes to pass that man *299* the *410* of a will which takes no *124* of *75* that comes under the head of *100* and *33*s and, on the *88*, *76*s *6*s as *11* to him, nay, even as *30* which can only be done by dis*66*ing all *100* and *128* *33*s. The *70* of such *6*s lies in him as an *130* and in the laws of *64*s and *6*s [which *293*] on the *1*s of an *168* world, of which *73* he knows *44* more than that in it pure *0* alone *163* of *149* gives the law; *303* since it is only in that world, as an *130*, that he is his *139* self (being as man only the *233* of *9*), those laws apply to him *247*ly and *35*ly, so that the *1922* of *33*s and *645* (in other words the whole *5* of the world of sense) *10* *1924* the laws of his *80* as an *130*. Nay, he does not even hold *9* *1925* for the *55* or *366* them to his *139* self, i.e., his will: he only *366*s to his will any *702* which he might yield them if he *709* them to *95* his *37* to the *642* of the *2* laws of the will.

When *4* *0* *479* *3* into a world of *39*, it does not *112* *1929* its own *416*, as it would if it tried to enter it by *359* or *320*. The *55* is only a *500* *94*t in *27* of the world of sense, which does not give any laws to *0* in *105* the will and is *478* only in this *290* point that this *14* as a *500* *284*istic is at the same time *717* with a (*478*) *118* and even with a *70* of *0*, which we *1934* a will, *46* a *118* of so *96* that the *1* of the *6*s shall *183* to the *444* *284* of a *2* *165*, i.e., the *34* that the maxim have *7* *144* as a law. But were it to *401* an *36* of will, that is, a *165*, from the world of *39*, then it would *639* its *370* and *529* to be *1936* with *53* of which it knows *44*. The *18* of a world of the *39* is then only a point of view which *0* finds *3* *937* to take *1937* the *233*s in order to *76* *3* as *4*, which would not be *11* if the *95*s of the *149* had a *105* power on man, but which is *30* *310* he is to be *947* the *174* of *9* as an *130* and, *61*, as a *2* cause, *1938* by *0*, that is, *1939* *690*. This *94*t *67*ly *323* the idea of an order and a *123* of laws *103* from that of the *1941* of *5* which *133* to the *128* world; and it makes the *18* of an *168* world *30* (that is to say, the whole *123* of *2* *22* as *93* in *50*). But it does not in the least *886*ize us to think of it *137* than as to its *200* *34* only, that is, the *7*ity of the *37* of the will as laws, and *61* the *65* of the *45*, which alone is *295* with its *14*; *248*, on the *88*, all laws that refer to a *178* *36* give *167*, which only *133* to laws of *5* and can only apply to the *128* world.

But *0* would *639* all its *370* if it *1942* to *180* how pure *0* can be *4*, which would be *607* the same *331* as to *180* how *14* is *11*.

For we can *180* *44* but that which we can *354* to laws, the *36* of which can be given in some *11* *38*. But *14* is a mere idea, the *36*ive *185* of which can in no wise be shown *62* to laws of *5*, and *61* not in any *11* *38*; and for this *0* it can never be *451*ed or *1943*, *23* we *10* *920* it by any sort of *164* or *443*. It holds good only as a *30* *237* of *0* in a being that *620*s *3* *362* of a will, that is, of a *118* *239* from mere *236* (*46*, a *118* of *105* *3* to *6* as an *130*, in other words, by laws of *0* *163*ly on *81* *302*s). Now where *155* *62* to laws of *5* *638*, there all *326* *638* also, and *44* *136* but *1946*, i.e., the *1947* of the *36*ions of those who *529* to have seen *1950* into the *5* of *93*, and *1951* *1952* *1953* *14* im*11*. We can only point out to them that the *169* *102* that they have *358*ed in it *268* only from this, that in order to be able to apply the law of *5* to human *6*s, they must *69* *255* man as an *233*: then when we *654* of them that they *8* also think of him qua *130* as a thing in *3*, they still *1954* in *255*ing him in this *27* also as an *233*. In this view it would no doubt be a *102* to *201* the *70* of the same *20* (that is, his will) to be *858* from all the *81* laws of the *128* world. But this *102* dis*423*, if they would only *1956* *50* and admit, as is *0*able, that *306* the *233*s there must also lie at their root (*31* *1958*) the *93* in *50*, and that we *10* *361* the laws of these to be the same as those that *1959* their *233*s.

The *20*ive im*190* of *180*ing the *14* of the will is *797* with the im*190* of *358*ing and *180*ing an *29* * which man can take in the moral law. Nevertheless he does *161* take an *29* in it, the basis of which in us we call the moral *97*, which some have *953* *466* as the *493* of our moral *89*, *248* it must *140* be *666* as the *20*ive *64* that the law *406*s on the will, the *36*ive *1* of which is *382*ed by *0* alone.

* Interest is that by which *0* *126*s *4*, i.e., a cause *105* the will. Hence we say of *2* *22* only that they take an *29* in a thing; ir*2* *22* only feel *1963* *645*. Reason takes a *247* *29* in *6* then only when the *7* *144* of its *37* is alone *355* to *85* the will. Such an *29* alone is pure. But if it can *85* the will only by means of *86* *36* of *236* or on the *656* of a *122* *97* of the *20*, then *0* takes only an in*247* *29* in the *6*, and, as *0* by *3* *13* *38* *10* *358* *120* *36*s of the will or a *187* *97* *636* it, this *45* *29* would only be *41* and not a pure *2* *29*. The *685* *29* of *0* (*46*, to *1966* its *453*) is never *247*, but pre*201*s *49*s for which *0* is *380*.

In order *73* that a *2* being who is also *192* *182* the *282* *8* will what *0* alone *247*s such *22* that they ought to will, it is no doubt *629* that *0* *8* have a power to *1969* a *97* of *251* or satisf*6* in the *910* of duty, that is to say, that it *8* have a *70* by which it *85*s the *149* *62* to its own *1*s. But it is quite im*11* to *223*, i.e., to make it *168* a *42*, how a mere *94*t, which *3* *205* *44* *128*, can *3* *203* a *320* of *251* or pain; for this is a *122* kind of *70* of which as of every other *70* we can *85* *44* *92* a *42*; we must only *1970* *38* about it. But as this *10* *471* us with any *90* of cause and *64* *214* *147* two *36*s of *38*, *248* in this case, *31* *73* the *64* *203*d lies *308* *38*, yet the cause is *169* to be pure *0* *96* *182* mere ideas which offer no *36* to *38*, it *114* that for us men it is quite im*11* to *180* how and why the *7*ity of the maxim as a law, that is, *19*, *29*s. This only is *67*, that it is not *23* it *29*s us that it has *144* for us (for that would be *167* and *293*ence of *4* *0* on *149*, *46*, on a *97* as its *1*, in which case it could never give moral laws), but that it *29*s us *23* it is valid for us as men, *279* as it had its *219* in our will as *130*s, in other words, in our *139* self, and what *133* to mere *233* is *69* *1228*d by *0* to the *5* of the thing in *3*.

The *72* then, "How a *35* *12* is *11*," can be *502*ed to this *624*, that we can *515* the only *237* on which it is *11*, *46*, the idea of *14*; and we can also *223* the *28* of this *237*, and this is *355* for the *4* *406* of *0*, that is, for the *959* of the *144* of this *12*, and hence of the moral law; but how this *237* *3* is *11* can never be *223*ed by any human *0*. On the *237*, *21*, that the will of an *130* is free, its *65*, as the *444* *200* *34* of its *155*, is a *30* *221*. Moreover, this *14* of will is not *24* quite *11* as a *237* (not *1973* any *102* to the *1* of *125* *28* in the *508* of the *415* of the *128* world) as *99* *26* can show: but *137*, a *2* being who is *362* of *70* *182* *0*, that is to say, of a will (*239* from *100*), must of *28* make it *4*ly, that is, in idea, the *34* of all his *1974* *6*s. But to *180* how pure *0* can be of *3* *4* *13* the aid of any *148* of *6* that could be *468*d from any other *219*, i.e., how the mere *1* of the *7* *144* of all its *37* as laws (which would *67*ly be the form of a pure *4* *0*) can of *3* *471* a *148*, *13* any *171* (*36*) of the will in which one could *1975* take any *29*; and how it can *203* an *29* which would be *43* *870* moral; or in other words, how pure *0* can be *4*- to *180* this is *294* the power of human *0*, and all the *384* and pains of *1977* an *326* of it are lost.

It is just the same as if I *564* to find out how *14* *3* is *11* as the *70* of a will. For then I quit the *222* of *291* *326*, and I have no other to go upon. I might *73* revel in the world of *130*s which still *136* to me, but *31* I have an idea of it which is well *314*, yet I have not the least *52* of it, nor an I ever *253* to such *52* with all the *755* of my *81* *118* of *0*. It *541* only a *53* that *136* over when I have *1979* *77* *87* to the world of sense from the *636* *1*s of my will, *582* *24* to keep in *370* the *1* of *165*s taken from the field of *149*; *1980* its *416* and *895* that it does not *281* all in all *308* *3*, but that there is more *294* it; but this *53* more I know no *137*. Of pure *0* which *963* this ideal, there *136* after the abstr*6* of all *171*, i.e., *52* of *36*s, *44* but the form, *46*, the *4* law of the *7*ity of the *37*, and in *183*ity with this *18* of *0* in *196* to a pure world of *39* as a *11* *242* cause, that is a cause *105* the will. There must here be a total *1981* of *148*s; *310* this idea of an *168* world is *3* the *148*, or that in which *0* *1982* takes an *29*; but to make this *168* is *296* the *331* that we *10* solve.

Here now is the *561* limit of all moral *317*, and it is of great *311* to *85* it even on this *124*, in order that *0* may not on the one band, to the *642* of *57*, seek about in the world of sense for the *63* *165* and an *29* *634* but *41*; and on the other hand, that it may not *1984* flap its wings *13* being able to move in the (for it) empty space of *1929*ent *195*s which we call the *168* world, and so lose *3* *831* *1022*s. For the rest, the idea of a pure world of *39* as a *123* of all *130*s, and to which we *58* as *2* *22* *234* (*31* we are *166* on the other side *107*s of the *128* world), this *136* *40* a *283* and *715* idea for the *49*s of *2* *1987*, *31* all *52* stops at its *1988*, *283*, *46*, to *203* in us a *528* *29* in the moral law by means of the noble ideal of a *7* *51* of ends in *50* (*2* *22*), to which we can *234* as *107*s then only when we *571* *129* *58* *62* to the *37* of *14* as if they were laws of *5*.

Concluding Remark

The *99* *385* of *0* with *27* to *5* leads to the *117* *28* of some *63* cause of the world: the *4* *385* of *0* with a view to *14* leads also to *117* *28*, but only of the laws of the *6*s of a *2* being as such. Now it is an *444* *1* of *0*, *21* *380*, to push its *52* to a *174* of its *28* (*13* which it would not be *2* *52*). It is, *21*, an *394* *444* re*258*ion of the same *0* that it can n*120* *223* the *28* of what is or what *259*s, nor of what ought to *259*, *310* a *34* is *169* on which it is or *259*s or ought to *259*. In this way, *21*, by the *1990* *317* for the *34*, the satisf*6* of *0* is only *137* and *137* *474*. Hence it uncea*1040* seeks the un*34*ally *30* and finds *3* *488* to *172* it, *31* *13* any means of *387* it *634* to *3*, happy *184* if only it can *358* a *18* which *621* with this *884*. It is *16* no fault in our *560* of the *63* *1* of *19*, but an *36*ion that *8* be made to human *0* in *47*, that it *10* *428* us to *76* the *117* *28* of an un*34*al *4* law (such as the *35* *12* must be). It *10* be *1993* for *2001* to *180* this *28* by a *34*, that is to say, by means of some *29* *172*d as a basis, since the law would then cease to be a *63* law of *0*. And thus while we do not *451* the *4* un*34*al *28* of the moral *12*, we yet *451* its *2002*, and this is all that can be *2003* *654*ed of a *26* which *2004* to carry its *1*s up to the very limit of human *0*.

THE END
