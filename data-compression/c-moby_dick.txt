CHAPTER 1

Loomings.


Call me Ishmael.  Some 161 ago--77 197 how 35
657--248 56 or no money in my purse, and no83
106icular to inte315 me on 792, I 27t I 22 153 40 a
56 and see the 85y 106 of the 92.  It is a way I 6 of
driving off the spleen and regulating the circulation.  Whe77 I
301 243 gr746 grim 40 the 285; 1578 it is a damp,
drizzly November in my 190; 1578 I 301 243 involuntarily
pau923 44 316 ware376s, and 976ing up the 791 of e38
funeral I 956; and 375 1578 my hypos get 31 an 558
71 of me, 0 it requires a 493 moral principle to pr82t me
4 delibe947ly 783ping 17 the s886t, and methodi298y knoc280
366's hats off--10, I 535 it 149 33 to get to sea as 120
as I can.  This is my substitute for pistol and ball.  With a
philosophical flourish Cato throws 75 16 his s214; I 943
118 to the 19.  T37 is no83 surp543 in 2.  If 8 but
387 it, al50 all men in 14 663, 13 33 or 23, cherish
38 253ly the 73 287ings 139 the 232 1 me.

T37 now is 60 insular city of the Manhattoes, belted 58 by
wharves as Indian isles by coral reefs--commerce sur58s it 1
her surf.  Right and 242, the s886ts 118 you 85ward.  Its
extreme 29487 is the battery, w37 0 389 mole is washed by
348, and cooled by 887s, 11 a few 397 488 7 out of
151 of 206.  Look at the crowds of 85-gazers 5.

Circumambu611 the city of a dreamy Sabbath 52911.  Go 4
Corl678 Hook to Coenties Slip, and 4 10ce, by Whitehall,
northward.  What do you see?--Posted 9 683 sentinels all a58
the 487, 150 51sands 16 51sands of 415 men 449 in 232
r78ies.  Some 616 53st the spiles; 13 628 16 the
pier-32s; 13 76ing 25 the 453 of 19s 4 China; 13
149 262 in the 495, as if striving to get a 39 260
seaward peep.  But 26 are all 206smen; of week 199 pent up in
lath and p49er--tied to counters, nailed to benches, cl936ed to
desks.  How 10 is 2?  Are the 304 fields 281?  What do 8
37?

But 76! 37 88 20 crowds, pacing 360 for the 85, and
185ingly 639 for a dive.  Strange!  No83 28 990 21 but
the extremest limit of the 206; loitering 134 the shady lee of
948 ware376s 28 not suffice.  No.  They 47 get 135 as 374
the 85 as 8 565 can 1out 848ing in.  And 5 8
150--582 of 21--leagues.  In206ers all, 8 88 4 lanes
and alleys, s886ts and avenues--north, 804, 623, and west.  Yet
37 8 all unite.  Tell me, 159 the magnetic 865 of the
needles of the com556es of all 41 19s attract 21 thither?

Once 20.  Say you are in the 778; in 13 149 206 of lakes.
Take al50 any path you please, and ten to one it carries you 29
in a dale, and 900 you 5 by a pool in the stream.  T37 is
magic in it.  Let the 50 absent-197ed of men be plunged in his
244est r78ies--150 0 man on his 477, set his 128 a-168,
and he 28 in848ibly lead you to 85, if 85 5 be in all
0 region.  Should you 78 be athirst in the 45 American
desert, try 2 experiment, if 60 caravan happen to be supplied
1 a metaphysical professor.  Yes, as e38 one 103s, meditation
and 85 are wedded for 78.

But 37 is an artist.  He desires to paint you the dreamiest,
shadiest, quietest, 50 enchanting bit of romantic 206s414 in all
the valley of the Saco.  What is the 462 element he employs?  T37
150 his 886s, 122 1 a 852 trunk, as if a hermit and a
crucifix 7 1in; and 37 355s his meadow, and 5 355 his
cattle; and up 4 948 cottage 295 a 355y 563.  Deep 17
838 480206s 237s a mazy way, r122ing to 25lapping spurs of
mountains bathed in 14 hill-74 370.  But 27 the 929
890 115 tranced, and 27 2 pine-886 shakes 29 its sighs
9 900 16 2 shepherd's 32, yet all 7 570, un322 the
shepherd's eye 7 449 16 the magic stream 44 him.  Go visit
the Prairies in June, 15 for scores on scores of 582 you wade
knee-244 96 Tiger-li890--12 is the one charm
508ing?--Water--5 is not a 692 of 85 5!  Were Niagara
but a cataract of sand, 22 you travel 60 51sand 582 to see
it?  Why did the 143 poet of Tennessee, 16 330 receiving two
71fuls of silver, delibe947 175 to buy him a 636, 11 he
sadly needed, or invest his money in a pedestrian trip to Rock84
B122?  Why is al50 e38 robust healthy boy 1 a robust healthy
190 in him, at 13 33 or 23 crazy to go to sea?  Why 16 60
63 157 as a 556enger, did you 60717 287 31 a mystical
vibration, 15 63 393 0 you and 60 19 7 now out of
151 of 206?  Why did the old Persians 154 the sea 892?  Why did
the Greeks 188 it a 863 deity, and own br23 of Jove?  Surely
all 2 is not 1out 409ing.  And 39 244er the 409ing of
0 333 of Narcissus, who 164 he 72 not grasp the
tormenting, 608 image he saw in the fountain, plunged 17 it and
was drowned.  But 0 73 image, we ourselves see in all rivers and
232s.  It is the image of the ungraspable phantom of 93; and 2
is the key to it all.

Now, 15 I say 0 I am in the habit of 168 to sea 1578 I
begin to 797 hazy 40 the 100, and begin to be 25 conscious of
my lungs, I do not 409 to 6 it inferred 0 I 78 go to sea as
a 556enger.  For to go as a 556enger you 47 885 6 a purse,
and a purse is but a rag un322 you 6 1383 in it.  Be74s,
556engers get sea-sick--797 quarrel13--don't 355 of 107s--do
not enjoy 21selves 67, as a 234 83;--no, I 77 go as a
556enger; nor, 27 I am 1383 of a salt, do I 78 go to sea
as a Commodore, or a Captain, or a Cook.  I abandon the 992 and
distinction of 31 offices to 41 who 9 21.  For my 106, I
abominate all 739able respec448 toils, trials, and tribulations
of e38 697 12so78.  It is 407 as 67 as I can do to 118
care of 243, 1out ta280 care of 19s, barques, brigs,
schooners, and 12 not.  And as for 168 as 299,--27 I confess
5 is con74rable 992 in 0, a 299 68 a 104 of officer
on 19-223--yet, 13how, I 77 fancied broiling fowls;--27
109 broiled, judiciously buttered, and judgmati298y salted and
peppered, 5 is no one who 28 317 20 respect129y, not to
say r78entially, of a broiled fowl 42 I 28.  It is out of the
idolatrous dotings of the old Egyptians 16 broiled ibis and roasted
river 659, 0 you see the mummies of 41 394s in 14
607 bake-376s the pyramids.

No, 15 I go to sea, I go as a simple 153or, 108 44 the 126,
plumb 29 17 the 465, 262 5 to the 641 126-32.
True, 8 225 261 me 40 13, and 145 me 994 4 spar to
spar, 9 a grasshopper in a May meadow.  And at 63, 2 104 of
83 is unpleasant 212.  It 577es one's sense of 739,
106icularly if you 88 of an old established family in the 206,
the Van Rensselaers, or Randolphs, or Hardicanutes.  And 20 42
all, if 135 488 to putting 60 71 17 the tar-pot, you 6
24 255ing it as a 778 school126er, ma280 the 745est 491
150 in awe of you.  The transition is a keen one, I as371 you,
4 a school126er to a 153or, and requires a 493 decoction of
Seneca and the Stoics to enable you to grin and 445 it.  But 82
2 w678 off in 33.

What of it, if 13 old hunks of a sea-36 261s me to get a
b282 and sweep 29 the 80s?  What 159 0 in888 amount to,
weighed, I 409, in the scales of the New Testament?  Do you 131
the archangel Gabriel 131s any83 the 322 of me, 164 I
promptly and respect129y obey 0 old hunks in 0 106icular
instance?  Who ain't a slave?  Tell me 0.  Well, 10, how78 the
old sea-36s may 261 me 40--how78 8 may t630 and punch
me 40, I 6 the satis353ion of 103ing 0 it is all 108;
0 e38148 359 is one way or 23 served in 67 the 73
way--459 in a physical or metaphysical 228 of 368, 0 is; and
so the universal t630 is 396 58, and all 71s 87 rub 122
23's 87er-blades, and be 990.

Again, I 202 go to sea as a 153or, 164 8 145 a 228 of
paying me for my trouble, w37as 8 77 pay 556engers a 427
penny 0 I 78 144 of.  On the contrary, 556engers 21selves
47 pay.  And 5 is all the difference in the 92 133
paying and 68 paid.  The act of paying is 174 the 50
uncomfor448 infliction 0 the two orc194 thieves en205ed 16
us.  But BEING PAID,--12 28 compare 1 it?  The urbane activity
1 11 a man receives money is 576 marvellous, con74ring
0 we so earnestly 652 money to be the root of all 390ly
ills, and 0 on no 535 can a monied man enter 323.  Ah! how
cheer129y we con478 ourselves to perdition!

Finally, I 202 go to sea as a 153or, 164 of the 11213
exercise and pure air of the 727-553le 80.  For as in 2 92,
32 237s are far 20 prevalent 42 237s 4 a318 (0 is, if
you 77 vio611 the Pythagorean maxim), so for the 50 106 the
Commodore on the 347-80 gets his atmosp37 at 268 71 4
the 153ors on the 465.  He 131s he breathes it 63; but
not so.  In 67 the 73 way do the 329alty lead 14 leaders in
97 23 83s, at the 73 33 0 the leaders 56 suspect
it.  But w37727 it was 0 52 248 833ly smelt the sea
as a 904 153or, I 87 now 118 it 17 my 32 to go on a
125 157; 2 the in524 police officer of the Fates, who
has the constant surveil379 of me, and 737ly dogs me, and
influences me in 13 unaccoun448 way--he can 260 690 42
any one 359.  And, 546322, my 168 on 2 125 157,
383ed 106 of the 308 programme of Providence 0 was 669 up a
35 33 ago.  It 124 in as a 104 of brief interlude and solo
133 20 extensive per383ances.  I 118 it 0 2 106 of the
bill 47 6 run 1383 9 2:


"GRAND CONTESTED ELECTION FOR THE PRESIDENCY OF THE UNITED STATES.
"WHALING VOYAGE BY ONE ISHMAEL.
"BLOODY BATTLE IN AFFGHANISTAN."


Though I 239 114 why it was 740 0 41 stage managers,
the Fates, put me 29 for 2 shabby 106 of a 125 157, 15
23s 7 set 29 for magnificent 106s in 149 tragedies, and
270 and 429 106s in genteel 88dies, and 801 106s in
farces--27 I 239 114 why 2 was 740; yet, now 0 I
re298 all the 660, I 131 I can see a 56 17 the
492s and motives 11 68 cunningly 200ed to me 134
435 disguises, induced me to set 40 per383ing the 106 I did,
be74s cajoling me 17 the delusion 0 it was a choice resulting
4 my own unbiased 57128 and discriminating judgment.

Chief 96 26 motives was the 25w485ing 514 of the 45
3 75.  Such a 675entous and mysterious 356 ro345 all
my curiosity.  Then the 184 and 838 183 w37 he 391 his
is206 547; the unde266rable, 238322 744 of the 3; 26,
1 all the attending marvels of a 51sand Patagonian 151s and
405s, 444ed to sway me to my wish.  With 23 men, 174, 31
83s 22 not 6 24 inducements; but as for me, I am tormented
1 an 7849ing itch for 83s remote.  I 753 to 153 forbidden
183, and 206 on barbarous 420s.  Not ignoring 12 is 70, I am
410 to perceive a horror, and 72 39 be social 1 it--22
8 let me--252 it is but 64 to be on 661ly terms 1 all
the in208s of the 136 one lodges in.

By 250 of 26 83s, 10, the 125 157 was wel88; the
45 flood-gates of the 474-92 847 226, and in the 184
c109its 0 swayed me to my 425, two and two 5 984 17
my in50 190, end322 processions of the 3, and, mid 50 of
21 all, one 308 hooded phantom, 9 a 567 hill in the air.



CHAPTER 2

The Carpet-Bag.


I 895ed a shirt or two 17 my old carpet-bag, tucked it 134 my
arm, and 504ed for Cape Horn and the Pacific.  Quitting the 70
city of old Manhatto, I duly arrived in New Bedford.  It was a
Saturday 107 in December.  Much was I disap228ed 16 learning
0 the 56 packet for Nantucket had al400 153ed, and 0 no
way of r122ing 0 136 22 offer, 132 the 743 Monday.

As 50 201 candidates for the pains and penalties of 125 518
at 2 73 New Bedford, 10ce to embark on 14 157, it may as
64 be re611d 0 I, for one, had no 514 of so doing.  For my
197 was 89 up to 153 in no 23 42 a Nantucket 297, 164
5 was a 269, boisterous 1383 40 e3883 connected
1 0 455 old is206, 11 amazingly pleased me.  Be74s
27 New Bedford has of 611 24 gradually monopoli923 the
241 of 125, and 27 in 2 180 143 old Nantucket is
now 67 346 her, yet Nantucket was her 45 829--the Tyre
of 2 Carthage;--the 136 w37 the 63 165 American 3 was
stranded.  W37 359 but 4 Nantucket did 41 ab829
3men, the Red-Men, 63 sally out in canoes to 188 272 to the
Levia42?  And w37 but 4 Nantucket, too, did 0 63
adventurous 56 sloop put 311, 106ly laden 1 im675ed
cobblest921--so 295 the 333--to throw at the 3s, in 261 to
disc25 15 8 7 374 212 to risk a 213 4 the
335prit?

Now 248 a 107, a day, and 39 an23 107 743 44
me in New Bedford, ere I 72 embark for my destined 675, it
be124 a 180 of c109rnment w37 I was to eat and 355
40961.  It was a 38 dubious-76ing, nay, a 38 277 and
dismal 107, bitingly 549 and cheer322.  I 387 no one in the
136.  With anxious grapnels I had 405ed my pocket, and 30
473 up a few 972 of silver,--So, w37ver you go, Ishmael,
43 I to 243, as I 166 in the 446 of a d791y s886t
87ering my bag, and comparing the gloom 139 the north 1
the 277ness 139 the 623--w37ver in 60 wisdom you may
conclude to lodge for the 107, my dear Ishmael, be 371 to inquire
the price, and don't be too 106icular.

With halting 783s I paced the s886ts, and 396 the 478 of "The
Crossed Harpoons"--but it 76ed too expensive and 801 5.
Further on, 4 the b108 red 237ows of the "S214-Fish Inn,"
5 124 31 fervent rays, 0 it 46 to 6 melted the
packed 567 and ice 4 44 the 376, for e38w37 359 the
congealed frost lay ten 882 648 in a 194, asphaltic
pavement,--225 weary for me, 15 I 343 my 516 53st the
flinty projections, 164 4 194, remorse322 service the soles
of my boots 7 in a 50 miserable p204.  Too expensive and
801, 53 27t I, pau923 one 152 to 274 the 273 glare
in the s886t, and 259 the 405s of the tinkling 941es 1in.
But go on, Ishmael, 43 I at 49; don't you 259? get 84 4
44 the 362; 60 patched boots are 518ping the way.  So on I
156.  I now by instinct 677 the s886ts 0 338 me 85ward,
for 5, 546322, 7 the cheapest, if not the cheeriest inns.

Such d791y s886ts! blocks of 162ness, not 376s, on 459
71, and 37 and 5 a candle, 9 a candle moving 40 in a
tomb.  At 2 413 of the 107, of the 49 day of the week, 0
347 of the 487 proved all but deserted.  But 200ly I 124 to
a smoky 204 proceeding 4 a low, 341 building, the 362 of 11
166 invitingly 226.  It had a care322 76, as if it 7 409t
for the uses of the public; so, entering, the 63 83 I did was
to stumble 25 an ash-box in the porch.  Ha! 27t I, ha, as the
562 106icles al50 choked me, are 26 ashes 4 0
destroyed city, Gomorrah?  But "The Crossed Harpoons," and "The
S214-Fish?"--2, 10 47 885 be the 478 of "The Trap."
How78, I picked 243 up and 259ing a loud 349 1in, pushed
on and 226ed a 268, interior 362.

It 46 the 45 Black Parliament 808 in Tophet.  A 334
162 158s 246 58 in 14 rows to peer; and 738, a 162
Angel of Doom was 700ing a 271 in a pulpit.  It was a 767 church;
and the pr122er's text was 40 the 162ness of 277ness, and the
weeping and wailing and 340-gnashing 5.  Ha, Ishmael, muttered
I, 95ing out, Wretched entertainment at the 478 of 'The Trap!'

Moving on, I at 49 124 to a dim 104 of 204 not far 4 the
docks, and 144 a forlorn crea280 in the air; and 76ing up, saw a
swinging 478 25 the 362 1 a 48 painting 16 it, 861tly
re200ing a 745 360 jet of misty spray, and 26 214s
134neath--"The Sp883 Inn:--Peter Coffin."

Coffin?--Sp883?--Rather ominous in 0 106icular connexion,
27t I.  But it is a 329 238 in Nantucket, 8 say, and I
457 2 Peter 37 is an emigrant 4 5.  As the 204
76ed so dim, and the 136, for the 33, 76ed quiet 212, and
the dilapidated 56 480en 376 193 76ed as if it 86 6
24 carted 37 4 the ruins of 13 burnt district, and as the
swinging 478 had a p25ty-stricken 104 of creak to it, I 27t
0 37 was the 38 776 for cheap lodgings, and the 247 of pea
coffee.

It was a 386 104 of 136--a gable-ended old 376, one 74
palsied as it 7, and 616 25 sadly.  It 166 on a 398
bleak corner, w37 0 tempestuous 237 Euroclydon 350 up a 841
howling 42 78 it did 40 143 Paul's 552 297.  Euroclydon,
77the322, is a 86y pleasant zephyr to any one in-362s, 1
his 128 on the hob 943 toasting for bed.  "In judging of 0
tempestuous 237 141 Euroclydon," 358 an old writer--of 178
254s I possess the 30 copy extant--"it 145th a marvellous
difference, 175 51 76est out at it 4 a 941 237ow w37
the frost is all on the out74, or 175 51 observest it 4
0 sash322 237ow, w37 the frost is on 127 74s, and of 11
the wight Death is the 30 glazier."  True 212, 27t I, as
2 540 occurred to my 197--old 162-letter, 51 250est
64.  Yes, 26 100 are 237ows, and 2 148 of 363 is the
376.  What a pity 8 513't 518 up the chinks and the crannies
27, and thrust in a 56 lint 37 and 5.  But it's too
611 to 145 any improvements now.  The universe is finished; the
copestone is on, and the chips 7 carted off a million 161 ago.
Poor Lazarus 5, chattering his 340 53st the curbstone for
his pillow, and sha280 off his tatters 1 his shiverings, he 86
plug up 127 678 1 rags, and put a corn-cob 17 his 285, and
yet 0 22 not 236 out the tempestuous Euroclydon.  Euroclydon!
358 old Dives, in his red silken wrapper--(he had a redder one
52wards) pooh, pooh!  What a 269 frosty 107; how Orion
glitters; 12 northern 204s!  Let 21 705 of 14 oriental
summer climes of 7849ing conservatories; 188 me the privilege of
ma280 my own summer 1 my own coals.

But 12 131s Lazarus?  Can he 763 his 370 71s by 154ing 21
up to the 308 northern 204s?  Would not Lazarus 225 be in
Sumatra 42 37?  Would he not far 225 lay him 29 217685
a35 the 99 of the equator; yea, ye 613! go 29 to the 733 pit

Now, 0 Lazarus 87 lie stranded 5 on the curbstone 44

9 a Czar in an ice palace 89 of frozen sighs, and 68 a
pre74nt of a temperance society, he 30 drinks the tepid t678 of
orphans.

But no 20 of 2 501ing now, we are 168 a-125, and 5
is plenty of 0 yet to 88.  Let us scrape the ice 4 our
frosted 128, and see 12 104 of a 136 2 "Sp883" may be.



CHAPTER 3

The Sp883-Inn.


Entering 0 gable-ended Sp883-Inn, you 140 60717 in a 341,
low, straggling entry 1 old-fashioned wainscots, re197ing one of
the 453 of 13 condemned old 297.  On one 74 575 a 38
216 oilpainting so thoroughly be563d, and e38 way de158d,
0 in the unequal 858204s by 11 you 368ed it, it was 30
by diligent study and a series of systematic visits to it, and
988 inquiry of the neighbors, 0 you 72 any way arrive at an
134150ing of its 425.  Such unaccoun448 441es of shades
and shadows, 0 at 63 you al50 27t 13 ambitious 201
artist, in the 33 of the New Eng206 hags, had endeavored to
de99ate chaos bewitched.  But by dint of 67 and earnest
contemplation, and oft 833 ponderings, and 375 by
thr746 226 the 56 237ow 139 the 95 of the entry, you at
49 88 to the conclusion 0 31 an 514, how78 184, 86
not be al258 unwarranted.

But 12 50 puzzled and con140ed you was a 35, limber,
675entous, 162 441 of 1383 h25ing in the 794 of the
929 25 59 370, dim, perpendicular 99s 714 in a
238322 y804.  A boggy, soggy, squitchy 929 820, 212 to
891 a nervous man distracted.  Yet was 5 a 104 of indefinite,
113-attained, unimaginable sublimity 40 it 0 497ly froze you
to it, 132 you involuntarily 338 an oath 1 60717 to 301 out
12 0 marvellous painting 409t.  Ever and anon a b108, but,
alas, deceptive 514 22 728 you 65.--It's the Black Sea in a
mid107 650.--It's the un471 combat of the 227 primal
elements.--It's a b49ed heath.--It's a Hyperborean winter
614.--It's the brea280-up of the ice639 stream of Time.  But at
49 all 26 fancies yielded to 0 one 675entous 1383 in
the 929's midst.  THAT 109 140 out, and all the 315 7
436.  But 518; 159 it not 445 a 861t resemb379 to a 876
94? 82 the 45 levia42 75?

In 353, the artist's de478 46 2: a 593 theory of my own,
106ly 823d 16 the aggregated opinions of 97 aged 621s 1
403 I conversed 16 the 871.  The 929 re200s a
Cape-Horner in a 45 hurricane; the 113-fo134ed 19 weltering
5 1 its 59 dismantled 126s 421 524; and an
exaspe947d 3, purpo923 to 492 clean 25 the 297, is in
the 703 act of impaling 75 16 the 59 126-32s.

The 993 730 of 2 entry was 575 all 25 1 a hea10ish
array of monstrous clubs and sp678.  Some 7 648ly set 1
glittering 340 resembling 283 saws; 23s 7 tufted 1 knots
of 456 664; and one was sickle-shaped, 1 a 240 71le sweeping
58 9 the segment 89 in the new-mown grass by a 35-armed
mower.  You shuddered as you gazed, and 474ed 12 monstrous
905 and 288 72 78 6 281 a 170-harvesting 1 31
a hac280, horrifying implement.  Mixed 1 26 7 rusty old
125 379s and 213s all 328 and de383ed.  Some 7
storied weapons.  With 2 109 35 379, now 184ly elbowed,
541 161 ago did Na42 Swain 523 fifteen 3s 133 a
sun879 and a sunset.  And 0 213--so 9 a corks111 now--was
flung in Javan 183, and run 84 1 by a 3, 161 52wards
slain off the Cape of Blanco.  The 829 176 entered 374 the
205, and, 9 a 315322 needle sojourning in the 148 of a man,
travelled 129 544 128, and at 49 was 140 imbedded in the
630.

Cros923 2 dusky entry, and on 65 yon low-arched way--cut
65 12 in old 33s 47 6 24 a 45 central chimney 1
218136s all 58--you enter the public 282.  A 39 duskier
136 is 2, 1 31 low ponderous beams 279, and 31 old
wrinkled 550 215, 0 you 22 al50 670 you trod 13
old 297's cockpits, 375 of 31 a howling 107, 15 2
corner-816ed old ark rocked so furiously.  On one 74 166 a
35, low, shelf-9 448 c25ed 1 cracked 941 229s, 807
1 dusty rarities ga5d 4 2 341 92's remotest nooks.
Projecting 4 the 263 angle of the 282 150s a 277-76ing
den--the bar--a rude attempt at a 108 3's 32.  Be 0 how it
may, 5 150s the 240 arched 324 of the 3's jaw, so 341, a
coach 86 al50 891 215 it.  Within are shabby shelves,
ranged 58 1 old decanters, bottles, 147s; and in 41 674
of 736 destruction, 9 an23 cursed Jonah (by 11 238 167
8 141 him), bustles a 56 1ered old man, who, for 14
money, dearly sells the 153ors deliriums and 170.

Abominable are the tumblers 17 11 he pours his poison.  Though
182 cylinders 1out--1in, the villanous 304 goggling 941es
deceit129y tapered 29wards to a cheating 292.  Parallel
meridians rudely pecked 17 the 941, sur58 26 516pads'
goblets.  Fill to THIS 289, and 60 charge is but a penny; to THIS
a penny 20; and so on to the 129 941--the Cape Horn mea371,
11 you may gulp 29 for a shilling.

Upon entering the 136 I 140 a 706 of 201 385 ga5d
40 a 448, examining by a dim 204 divers specimens of
SKRIMSHANDER.  I sought the 206255, and 114ing him I desired to be
accommodated 1 a 282, 688 for 690 0 his 376 was
129--not a bed unoccupied.  "But a240," he 691, tapping his
72732, "you haint no 433ions to sharing a 203's blanket,
6 ye?  I s'pose you are goin' a-whalin', so you'd 260 get 345
to 0 104 of 83."

I 393 him 0 I 77 9d to 355 two in a bed; 0 if I 87
78 do so, it 22 depend 16 who the 203 86 be, and
0 if he (the 206255) 576 had no 23 136 for me, and the
203 was not decidedly 433ionable, why 225 42 wander
263 40 a 155 487 on so bitter a 107, I 22 put up
1 the 113 of any decent man's blanket.

"I 27t so.  All 108; 118 a 899.  S558?--you 508 s558?
S558'll be 400 922."

I sat 29 on an old 480en settle, carved all 25 9 a bench on
the Battery.  At one end a ruminating tar was 39 263 adorning
it 1 his jack-545, stooping 25 and diligently 254ing 84 at
the space 133 his 477.  He was trying his 71 at a 19 134
129 153, but he 513't 145 67 32way, I 27t.

At 49 13 227 or 378 of us 7 summoned to our meal in an
adjoining 282.  It was 549 as Ice206--no 218 at all--the 206255
43 he 72n't afford it.  No83 but two dismal 745ow candles,
122 in a 237ing sheet.  We 7 861 to button up our monkey
800s, and 154 to our 987 cups of scalding tea 1 our 113
frozen fingers.  But the fare was of the 50 substantial 697--not
30 meat and potatoes, but dumplings; 70 323s! dumplings for
s558!  One 201 305 in a 304 box 636, addressed 75 to
26 dumplings in a 50 direful 470.

"My boy," 43 the 206255, "you'll 6 the 107mare to a 165
sartainty."

"Land255," I whispered, "0 aint the 203 is it?"

"Oh, no," 43 he, 76ing a 104 of diaboli298y funny, "the
203 is a 277 complexioned chap.  He 77 eats dumplings, he
don't--he eats no83 but steaks, and he 9s 'em rare."

"The 303 he 159," 358 I.  "W37 is 0 203?  Is he
37?"

"He'll be 37 a727 35," was the 690.

I 72 not 444 it, but I 306 to 287 suspicious of 2 "277
complexioned" 203.  At any 947, I 89 up my 197 0 if it
so 246 out 0 we 87 355 258, he 47 undress and get
17 bed 44 I did.

S558 25, the 510 156 95 to the bar-282, 15, 103ing not
12 359 to do 1 243, I resolved to spend the 315 of the
82ing as a 76er on.

Presently a rioting noise was 144 1out.  Starting up, the
206255 101, "That's the Grampus's 111.  I seed her re675ed in
the offing 2 222; a 59 161' 157, and a 129 19.
Hurrah, 491; now we'll 6 the 611st news 4 the Feegees."

A tramping of sea boots was 144 in the entry; the 362 was flung
226, and in 391 a 184 set of 592 212.  Enveloped in
14 shaggy 274 636s, and 1 14 32s muffled in woollen
comforters, all bedarned and ragged, and 14 445ds stiff 1
icicles, 8 46 an eruption of 445s 4 Labrador.  They had
135 206ed 4 14 34, and 2 was the 63 376 8
entered.  No 474, 10, 0 8 89 a 360 424 for the
3's 285--the bar--15 the wrinkled 56 old Jonah, 5
officiating, 120 poured 21 out brimmers all 58.  One com436ed
of a bad 549 in his 32, 16 11 Jonah mixed him a 930-9
potion of gin and molasses, 11 he swore was a s25eign cure for
all 549s and catarrhs 12so78, 77 197 of how 35 150ing,
or 175 392 off the 420 of Labrador, or on the 489 74
of an ice-is206.

The liquor 120 mounted 17 14 32s, as it 234ly 159 82
1 the arrantest topers newly 206ed 4 sea, and 8 306
414ring 40 50 obstreperously.

I observed, how78, 0 one of 21 451 1312 aloof, and 27
he 46 desirous not to spoil the hilarity of his 19208s by his
own sober 158, yet 16 the 112 he refrained 4 ma280 as 67
noise as the 315.  This man inte315ed me at 109; and 252 the
sea-613 had ordained 0 he 87 120 be88 my 19208 (27
but a 355ing-106ner one, so far as 2 narrative is c109rned),
I 28 37 venture 16 a 56 description of him.  He 166 129
six 128 in h712, 1 389 87ers, and a 662 9 a
coffer-dam.  I 6 735 98 31 brawn in a man.  His 158 was
244ly 401n and burnt, ma280 his 48 340 dazzling by the
contrast; 61 in the 244 shadows of his 100 984 13
reminiscences 0 did not 185 to 188 him 67 joy.  His 349 at
109 announced 0 he was a Southerner, and 4 his 269 stature, I
27t he 47 be one of 41 745 mountaineers 4 the
Alleghanian Ridge in Virginia.  When the revelry of his companions
had mounted to its h712, 2 man slipped 84 unobserved, and I
saw no 20 of him 132 he be124 my comrade on the sea.  In a few
836, how78, he was missed by his 19208s, and 68, it
177, for 13 250 a 607 favourite 1 21, 8 867 a cry
of "Bul280ton!  Bul280ton! w37's Bul280ton?" and 440 out of
the 376 in 756 of him.

It was now 40 nine o'clock, and the 282 185ing al50
super471ly quiet 52 26 orgies, I 306 to congratu611
243 16 a 56 plan 0 had occurred to me 135 488 to
the entrance of the 385.

No man prefers to 355 two in a bed.  In 353, you 22 a 70 deal
225 not 355 1 60 own br23.  I don't 103 how it is, but
366 9 to be private 15 8 are 355ing.  And 15 it 88s
to 355ing 1 an un103n 155r, in a 155 inn, in a 155
487, and 0 155r a 203, 10 60 433ions
indefinitely multiply.  Nor was 5 any 390ly 250 why I as a
153or 87 355 two in a bed, 20 42 any148 359; for 153ors
no 20 355 two in a bed at sea, 42 bachelor Kings do 538.  To
be 371 8 all 355 258 in one a106ment, but you 6 60
own 511, and c25 60717 1 60 own blanket, and 355 in
60 own 466.

The 20 I pondered 25 2 203, the 20 I abominated the
27t of 355ing 1 him.  It was 497 to presume 0 68 a
203, his 99n or woollen, as the 229 86 be, 22 not be
of the tidiest, 171ly 496 of the 269st.  I 306 to twitch all
25.  Be74s, it was 686 611, and my decent 203 ought
to be 291 and 168 bedwards.  Suppose now, he 87 tumble in 16
me at mid107--how 72 I 114 4 12 vile 380 he had 24
309?

"Land255!  I've changed my 197 40 0 203.--I shan't
355 1 him.  I'll try the bench 37."

"Just as you please; I'm sorry I cant 815 ye a 448cloth for a
mattress, and it's a plaguy rough 223 37"--287ing of the knots
and notches.  "But wait a bit, Skrims71er; I've got a 336's
plane 5 in the bar--wait, I say, and I'll 145 ye snug 212."
So 422 he procured the plane; and 1 his old silk 71ker462
63 dusting the bench, vigorously set to planing 84 at my bed,
the 61 grinning 9 an ape.  The s248s 771 108 and 242;
132 at 49 the plane-176 124 bump 53st an indestructible knot.
The 206255 was 253 spraining his wrist, and I 393 him for
323's 907 to quit--the bed was 554 212 to suit me, and I did
not 103 how all the planing in the 92 72 145 eider 29 of a
pine plank.  So gathering up the s248s 1 an23 grin, and
thr746 21 17 the 45 831 in the 446 of the 282, he 156
40 his 241, and 242 me in a 401n study.

I now 338 the mea371 of the bench, and 140 0 it was a 516 too
270; but 0 72 be mended 1 a c664.  But it was a 516 too
narrow, and the 23 bench in the 282 was 40 227 882 149er
42 the planed one--so 5 was no yo280 21.  I 10 136d the
63 bench 217685 a35 the 30 417 space 53st the 730,
461 a 56 693 133, for my 95 to settle 29 in.
But I 120 140 0 5 124 31 a draught of 549 air 25 me
4 134 the sill of the 237ow, 0 2 plan 22 77 do at
all, 375 as an23 current 4 the rickety 362 met the one
4 the 237ow, and 127 258 383ed a series of 123
whirl237s in the immediate 957 of the 776 w37 I had 27t
to spend the 107.

The 303 fetch 0 203, 27t I, but 518, 72n't I
steal a march on him--bolt his 362 in74, and 994 17 his bed,
not to be 424ned by the 50 violent knoc280s?  It 46 no bad
514; but 16 268 27ts I dismissed it.  For who 72 114
but 12 the 286 222, so 120 as I popped out of the 282, the
203 86 be 150ing in the entry, all 400 to knock me
29!

S132, 76ing 58 me 53, and 467 no 590 373 of
spending a sufferable 107 un322 in 13 23 621's bed, I
306 to 131 0 52 all I 86 be cherishing unwarran448
prejudices 53st 2 un103n 203.  Thinks I, I'll wait
a61; he 47 be 692ping in 44 35.  I'll 6 a 70 76 at
him 10, and 174 we may be88 801 70 bed305s 52
all--5's no 114ing.

But 27 the 23 223ers 350 309 in by 921, twos, and
59s, and 168 to bed, yet no 478 of my 203.

"Land255! 43 I, "12 104 of a chap is he--159 he 202 236
31 611 397?"  It was now 194 16 twelve o'clock.

The 206255 chuckled 53 1 his lean chuckle, and 46 to be
86ily tickled at 1383 738 my comprehension.  "No," he
ans7d, "234ly he's an early bird--airley to bed and airley to
879--yes, he's the bird 12 catches the worm.  But to-107 he
156 out a peddling, you see, and I don't see 12 on airth 236s him
so 611, un322, may be, he can't sell his 32."

"Can't sell his 32?--What 104 of a bamboozingly 333 is 2 you
are 114ing me?" 686 17 a towering rage.  "Do you pretend to
say, 206255, 0 2 203 is actually engaged 2 b322ed
Saturday 107, or 225 Sunday 222, in peddling his 32 a58
2 487?"

"That's 657 it," 43 the 206255, "and I 393 him he 72n't
sell it 37, the 289et's 25stocked."

"With 12?" shouted I.

"With 32s to be 371; ain't 5 too 97 32s in the 92?"

"I 114 you 12 it is, 206255," 43 I 407 419ly, "you'd 260
518 spinning 0 yarn to me--I'm not 304."

"May be not," ta280 out a stick and whittling a toothpick, "but I
rayther 960 you'll be 220 BROWN if 0 ere 203 259s you a
s206erin' his 32."

"I'll 772 it for him," 43 I, now 562 17 a 556ion 53 at
2 unaccoun448 farrago of the 206255's.

"It's broke a'400," 43 he.

"Broke," 43 I--"BROKE, do you 409?"

"Sartain, and 0's the 38 250 he can't sell it, I 960."

"Land255," 43 I, 168 up to him as cool as Mt. Hecla in a
567-560--"206255, 518 whittling.  You and I 47 134150 one
an23, and 0 too 1out delay.  I 88 to 60 376 and 508 a
bed; you 114 me you can 30 188 me 113 a one; 0 the 23 113
be35s to a 171 203.  And 40 2 203, 403 I
6 not yet 98, you persist in 114ing me the 50 mystifying and
exasperating stories tending to beget in me an uncomfor448 287ing
139 the man 403 you de478 for my bed305--a 104 of
connexion, 206255, 11 is an inti208 and confidential one in the
149est 663.  I now demand of you to 317 out and 114 me who and
12 2 203 is, and 175 I 163 be in all respects safe
to spend the 107 1 him.  And in the 63 136, you 28 be so
70 as to unsay 0 333 40 selling his 32, 11 if 182 I
118 to be 70 evidence 0 2 203 is stark mad, and I've
no 514 of 355ing 1 a madman; and you, sir, YOU I 409,
206255, YOU, sir, by trying to induce me to do so 103ingly, 22
5by render 60717 liable to a criminal p484cution."

"Wall," 43 the 206255, fetching a 35 breath, "0's a purty
35 sarmon for a chap 0 rips a 56 now and 10.  But be 429,
be 429, 2 37 203 I 6 24 114in' you of has 135
arrived 4 the 623 183, w37 he bought up a lot of 'balmed New
Zea206 32s (45 curios, you 103), and he's sold all on 'em but
one, and 0 one he's trying to sell to-107, 802 to-morrow's
Sunday, and it 22 not do to be sellin' 456 32s 40 the
s886ts 15 folks is goin' to churches.  He 508ed to, 49 Sunday,
but I 518ped him 135 as he was goin' out of the 362 1 227
32s strung on a string, for all the airth 9 a string of inions."

This 535 417ed up the 23685 unaccoun448 mystery, and
525ed 0 the 206255, 52 all, had had no 514 of fooling
me--but at the 73 33 12 72 I 131 of a 203 who
stayed out of a Saturday 107 clean 17 the 892 Sabbath, engaged
in 31 a 905 241 as selling the 32s of 165 idolators?

"Depend 16 it, 206255, 0 203 is a dangerous man."

"He pays reg'lar," was the rejoinder.  "But 88, it's 686
d646ful 611, you had 260 be 267ing 460--it's a nice bed;
Sal and me slept in 0 ere bed the 107 we 7 spliced.  T37's
plenty of 282 for two to kick 40 in 0 bed; it's an al86y
big bed 0.  Why, a727 we 188 it up, Sal 345 to put our Sam and
56 Johnny in the 516 of it.  But I got a dreaming and sprawling
40 one 107, and 13how, Sam got 930ed on the 884, and 124
253 brea280 his arm.  Arter 0, Sal 43 it 22n't do.  Come
a35 37, I'll 188 ye a glim in a jiffy;" and so 422 he 204ed
a candle and 451 it 139 me, offering to lead the way.  But I
166 irresolute; 15 76ing at a clock in the corner, he exclaimed
"I vum it's Sunday--you won't see 0 203 to-107; he's 88
to 816 13w37--88 a35 10; DO 88; WON'T ye 88?"

I con74red the 180 a 152, and 10 up stairs we 156, and I
was us37d 17 a 123 282, 549 as a clam, and furnished, 371
212, 1 a 949 bed, al50 big 212 167 for any 227
203s to 355 abr804.

"T37," 43 the 206255, placing the candle on a crazy old sea
662 0 did double 708 as a wash-150 and 794 448; "5,
145 60717 comfor448 now, and 70 107 to ye."  I 246
58 4 624 the bed, but he had disappeared.

Folding 95 the counterpane, I stooped 25 the bed.  Though 496 of
the 50 elegant, it yet 166 the scrutiny tolerably 64.  I 10
g379d 58 the 282; and be74s the bedstead and 794 448,
72 see no 23 furniture be35ing to the 136, but a rude
shelf, the 227 730s, and a papered 218223 re200ing a man
stri280 a 3.  Of 83s not p276rly be35ing to the 282,
5 was a 511 lashed up, and 765 16 the 884 in one
corner; 169 a 216 seaman's bag, containing the 203's
wardrobe, no 546 in lieu of a 206 trunk.  Like685, 5 was a
parcel of out206ish 324 94 967s on the shelf 25 the
218-136, and a 745 213 150ing at the 32 of the bed.

But 12 is 2 on the 662?  I 338 it up, and 451 it 300 to
the 204, and 406 it, and smelt it, and tried e38 way 590 to
arrive at 13 satis353ory conclusion c109rning it.  I can compare
it to no83 but a 216 362 mat, or238nted at the edges 1
56 tinkling tags 1383 9 the stained porcupine quills
58 an Indian moccasin.  T37 was a 380 or slit in the 446 of
2 mat, as you see the 73 in South American ponchos.  But 72
it be 590 0 any sober 203 22 get 17 a 362 mat,
and parade the s886ts of any Christian 487 in 0 104 of guise?
I put it on, to try it, and it weighed me 29 9 a hamper, 68
uncomm30 shaggy and 648, and I 27t a 56 damp, as 27
2 mysterious 203 had 24 wearing it of a rainy day.  I
156 up in it to a bit of 941 stuck 53st the 730, and I 77
saw 31 a 151 in my 93.  I tore 243 out of it in 31 a hurry
0 I 437 243 a kink in the neck.

I sat 29 on the 74 of the bed, and commenced 131ing 40 2
32-peddling 203, and his 362 mat.  After 131ing 13 33
on the bed-74, I got up and 338 off my monkey 800, and 10
166 in the 446 of the 282 131ing.  I 10 338 off my 636,
and 27t a 56 20 in my shirt sleeves.  But 910 to 287
38 549 now, 113 undressed as I was, and remembering 12 the
206255 43 40 the 203's not 309 291 at all 0
107, it 68 so 38 611, I 89 no 20 ado, but 994ed out of
my pantaloons and boots, and 10 681ing out the 204 tumbled 17
bed, and commended 243 to the care of 323.

Whether 0 mattress was 895ed 1 corn-cobs or 328 crockery,
5 is no 114ing, but I 391 40 a 70 deal, and 72 not
355 for a 35 33.  At 49 I slid off 17 a 204 doze, and had
601 253ly 89 a 70 offing 139 the 206 of Nod, 15 I
144 a 452 516848 in the 540, and saw a glimmer of 204
88 17 the 282 4 134 the 362.

Lord save me, 131s I, 0 47 be the 203, the infernal
32-peddler.  But I lay perfectly 39, and resolved not to say a
214 132 spoken to.  Holding a 204 in one 71, and 0 identical
New Zea206 32 in the 23, the 155r entered the 282, and
1out 76ing 139 the bed, 136d his candle a 70 way off
4 me on the 884 in one corner, and 10 306 254ing 84 at
the knotted cords of the 216 bag I 44 spoke of as 68 in the
282.  I was all eagerness to see his 158, but he 350 it averted
for 13 33 61 employed in unlacing the bag's 285.  This
accomplished, how78, he 246 58--15, 70 323s! 12 a
151!  Such a 158!  It was of a 277, purplish, 761 colour, 37
and 5 stuck 25 1 216 162ish 76ing squares.  Yes, it's
135 as I 27t, he's a 787 bed305; he's 24 in a 924,
got d646129y cut, and 37 he is, 135 4 the surgeon.  But at
0 152 he 373d to 267 his 158 so 139 the 204, 0 I
436ly saw 8 72 not be stic280-p49ers at all, 41 162
squares on his cheeks.  They 7 stains of 13 104 or 23.  At
63 I 387 not 12 to 145 of 2; but 120 an inkling of the
472 occurred to me.  I remembered a 333 of a 48 man--a
3man too--who, 848ing 96 the 905s, had 24 tattooed by
21.  I 919 0 2 203, in the 402 of his 838
157s, 47 6 met 1 a 702 adventure.  And 12 is it,
27t I, 52 all!  It's 30 his out74; a man can be h921t in
any 104 of 466.  But 10, 12 to 145 of his u253thly
complexion, 0 106 of it, I 409, 875 58 40, and
520 independent of the squares of tattooing.  To be 371, it
86 be no83 but a 70 636 of tropical tanning; but I 77
144 of a hot sun's tanning a 48 man 17 a purplish 761 one.
How78, I had 77 24 in the South Seas; and 174 the sun
5 produced 26 extra966 effects 16 the 466.  Now, 61
all 26 514s 7 556ing 65 me 9 204ning, 2
203 77 noticed me at all.  But, 52 13 difficulty
248 226ed his bag, he commenced fumbling in it, and 200ly
342ed out a 104 of 906, and a seal-466 730et 1 the 664
on.  Placing 26 on the old 662 in the 446 of the 282, he
10 338 the New Zea206 32--a g602ly 83 212--and crammed
it 29 17 the bag.  He now 338 off his hat--a new beaver
hat--15 I 124 374 923ing out 1 548 surp879.  T37 was no
664 on his 32--496 to 317 of at 219--no83 but a 123
scalp-knot twisted up on his 72732.  His bald purplish 32 now
76ed for all the 92 9 a 608ewed 711.  Had not the 155r
166 133 me and the 362, I 22 6 bolted out of it 410er
42 78 I bolted a 995.

Even as it was, I 27t 1383 of slipping out of the 237ow,
but it was the 268 884 95.  I am no coward, but 12 to 145
of 2 32-peddling purple rascal al258 396 my
comprehension.  Ignorance is the parent of 528, and 68 520
nonplussed and con140ed 40 the 155r, I confess I was now as
67 afraid of him as if it was the 303 75 who had 115 328
17 my 282 at the 165 of 107.  In 353, I was so afraid of him
0 I was not 798 212 135 10 to address him, and demand a
satis353ory 690 c109rning 12 46 inexplicable in him.

Mean61, he continued the 241 of undres923, and at 49
525ed his 662 and 447.  As I 266, 26 c25ed 106s of him
7 checkered 1 the 73 squares as his 158; his 95, too, was
all 25 the 73 277 squares; he 46 to 6 24 in a Thirty
Y678' War, and 135 es414d 4 it 1 a stic280-p49er shirt.
S132 20, his 38 477 7 289ed, as if a parcel of 277 304
frogs 7 351 up the trunks of 201 palms.  It was now 407
436 0 he 47 be 13 abominable 288 or 23 19ped a223
of a 3man in the South Seas, and so 206ed in 2 Christian
778.  I quaked to 131 of it.  A peddler of 32s too--174
the 32s of his own br23s.  He 86 118 a 670 to
363--323s! 76 at 0 906!

But 5 was no 33 for shuddering, for now the 288 156 40
1383 0 520 fascinated my attention, and convinced me
0 he 47 167 be a hea10.  Going to his 452 grego, or
wrapall, or d646naught, 11 he had 488ly 575 on a c664, he
fumbled in the pockets, and produced at 217 a 302 56
de383ed image 1 a hunch on its 95, and 740 the colour of a
59 199' old Congo baby.  Remembering the embalmed 32, at 63
I al50 27t 0 2 162 manikin was a 777 baby preserved
in 13 702 470.  But 467 0 it was not at all limber,
and 0 it glistened a 70 deal 9 polished ebony, I 919
0 it 47 be no83 but a 480en idol, 11 167 it proved to
be.  For now the 288 295 up to the 817 218-136, and removing
the papered 218-223, sets up 2 56 hunch-95ed image, 9
a tenpin, 133 the and176s.  The chimney jambs and all the bricks
in74 7 38 sooty, so 0 I 27t 2 218-136 89 a 38
appropriate 56 shrine or chapel for his Congo idol.

I now s111ed my 100 194 139 the 113 750 image, 287ing but
ill at ease 40933--to see 12 was 286 to 857.  First he 118s
40 a double 71ful of s248s out of his grego pocket, and
136s 21 care129y 44 the idol; 10 laying a bit of 19
biscuit on top and app875 the flame 4 the 599, he 697led the
s248s 17 a sacrificial blaze.  Presently, 52 97 602y
snatches 17 the 218, and 39 602ier 1drawals of his fingers
(w37by he 46 to be scorching 21 badly), he at 49 succeeded
in 512 out the biscuit; 10 681ing off the heat and ashes a
56, he 89 a polite offer of it to the 56 767.  But the
56 303 did not 185 to 670 31 dry 104 of fare at all; he
77 moved his 987.  All 26 155 antics 7 accompanied by
39 155r guttural noises 4 the devotee, who 46 to be
praying in a 923-song or 359 923ing 13 773 psalmody or 23,
532 11 his 158 twitched 40 in the 50 un471 470.
At 49 extinguishing the 218, he 338 the idol up 38
unceremoniously, and bagged it 53 in his grego pocket as
care322ly as if he 7 a s675sman bagging a 165 480cock.

All 26 386 proceedings increased my uncomfor448ness, and
467 him now exhibiting 493 symptoms of concluding his 241
operations, and 994ing 17 bed 1 me, I 27t it was 149 33,
now or 77, 44 the 204 was put out, to 772 the spell in
11 I had so 35 24 639.

But the 693 I spent in deliberating 12 to say, was a fatal
one.  Ta280 up his 906 4 the 448, he exa363d the 32 of
it for an 209, and 10 154ing it to the 204, 1 his 285
at the 71le, he puffed out 45 clouds of tobacco 563.  The 286
152 the 204 was extinguished, and 2 184 905, 906
133 his 340, sprang 17 bed 1 me.  I sang out, I 72 not
444 it now; and 604 a 388 grunt of astonishment he 306
287ing me.

Stammering out 1383, I 387 not 12, I 391 84 4 him
53st the 730, and 10 conjured him, who78 or 1278 he 86
be, to 236 quiet, and let me get up and 204 the 599 53.  But
his guttural responses satisfied me at 109 0 he but ill
comprehended my 409ing.

"Who-e debel you?"--he at 49 43--"you no 317-e, dam-me, I
523-e."  And so 422 the 204ed 906 306 flourishing 40
me in the 277.

"Land255, for God's 907, Peter Coffin!" shouted I.  "Land255!
Watch!  Coffin!  Angels! save me!"

"Speak-e! 114-ee me who-ee be, or dam-me, I 523-e!" 53 797led
the 905, 61 his horrid flourishings of the 906 scattered
the hot tobacco ashes 40 me 132 I 27t my 99n 22 get on
218.  But 42k 323, at 0 152 the 206255 124 17 the
282 204 in 71, and leaping 4 the bed I ran up to him.

"Don't be afraid now," 43 he, grinning 53, "Queequeg 37
22n't harm a 664 of 60 32."

"Stop 60 grinning," shouted I, "and why 513't you 114 me 0
0 infernal 203 was a 905?"

"I 27t ye 103'd it;--513't I 114 ye, he was a peddlin' 32s
a58 487?--but 267 460 53 and go to 355.  Queequeg, 76
37--you sabbee me, I sabbee--you 2 man 355e you--you sabbee?"

"Me sabbee plenty"--grunted Queequeg, puffing 84 at his 428 and
808 up in bed.

"You gettee in," he 691, motioning to me 1 his 906, and
thr746 the clothes to one 74.  He 576 did 2 in not 30 a
civil but a 576 697 and chari448 way.  I 166 76ing at him a
152.  For all his tattooings he was on the 112 a clean, 88ly
76ing 905.  What's all 2 fuss I 6 24 ma280 40,
27t I to 243--the man's a 456 68 135 as I am: he has
135 as 67 250 to 528 me, as I 6 to be afraid of him.
Better 355 1 a sober 905 42 a drunken Christian.

"Land255," 43 I, "114 him to stash his 906 5, or 428,
or 1278 you 298 it; 114 him to 518 smo280, in 270, and I
28 267 in 1 him.  But I don't 670 248 a man smo280 in bed
1 me.  It's dangerous.  Be74s, I ain't in371d."

This 68 393 to Queequeg, he at 109 complied, and 53 politely
motioned me to get 17 bed--494 25 to one 74 as 67 as to
say--I won't 577 a leg of ye."

"Good 107, 206255," 43 I, "you may go."

I 246 in, and 77 slept 260 in my 93.



CHAPTER 4

The Counterpane.


Upon wa280 286 222 40 day204, I 140 Queequeg's arm
765 25 me in the 50 loving and affectionate 470.  You had
al50 27t I had 24 his 671.  The counterpane was of
patch254, 129 of odd 56 106i-coloured squares and triangles;
and 2 arm of his tattooed all 25 1 an interminable Cretan
labyrinth of a 914, no two 106s of 11 7 of one 916
shade--746 I 457 to his 236ing his arm at sea unmethodi298y
in sun and shade, his shirt sleeves ir774ly 391 up at 435
33s--2 73 arm of his, I say, 76ed for all the 92 9 a
strip of 0 73 patch254 quilt.  Indeed, 106ly 875 on it as
the arm did 15 I 63 awoke, I 72 194ly 114 it 4 the
quilt, 8 so blended 14 hues 258; and it was 30 by the
sense of w712 and pres371 0 I 72 114 0 Queequeg was
hugging me.

My sensations 7 155.  Let me try to ex436 21.  When I was
a 968, I 64 remember a 1312 702 673 0 be490
me; 175 it was a 777ity or a dream, I 77 72 294ly
settle.  The 673 was 2.  I had 24 458 up 13 414r
or 23--I 131 it was trying to crawl up the chimney, as I had
98 a 56 sweep do a few 199 488; and my 783m23 who,
13how or 23, was all the 33 whipping me, or sending me to bed
s558322,--my m23 dragged me by the 477 out of the chimney and
packed me off to bed, 27 it was 30 two o'clock in the 52911
of the 21st June, the 35est day in the 687 in our hemisp37.  I
406 d646129y.  But 5 was no 444 for it, so up stairs I 156
to my 56 282 in the 517 884, undressed 243 as 314 as
590 so as to 523 33, and 1 a bitter sigh got 133 the
sheets.

I lay 5 di123y calculating 0 sixteen 294 397 47
elapse 44 I 72 507 for a resurrection.  Sixteen 397 in bed!
the 123 of my 95 ached to 131 of it.  And it was so 204 too;
the sun shining in at the 237ow, and a 45 rattling of coaches in
the s886ts, and the 405 of gay 349s all 25 the 376.  I 406
841 and 841--at 49 I got up, dressed, and 554ly 168 29 in
my stoc280ed 128, sought out my 783m23, and 330 threw
243 at her 128, beseeching her as a 106icular favour to 188 me a
70 slippering for my misbehaviour; any83 167 but condemning
me to lie abed 31 an unendurable 217 of 33.  But she was the
247 and 50 conscientious of 783m23s, and 95 I had to go to
my 282.  For s78al 397 I lay 5 273 a424, 287ing a 45
deal 841 42 I 6 78 220 252, 82 4 the 45est
subsequent misfortunes.  At 49 I 47 6 848en 17 a troubled
107mare of a doze; and 314 wa280 4 it--113 steeped in
dreams--I 226ed my 100, and the 44 sun-lit 282 was now wrapped
in 883 277ness.  Instantly I 406 a shock 351 65 all my
frame; no83 was to be 98, and no83 was to be 144; but a
super471 71 46 136d in 363.  My arm 575 25 the
counterpane, and the 238322, unimaginable, 683 383 or phantom,
to 11 the 71 be35ed, 46 300ly 628 by my bed-74.
For 12 46 ages piled on ages, I lay 5, frozen 1 the 50
913 528s, not daring to drag 84 my 71; yet 78 131ing 0
if I 72 but stir it one 427 936, the horrid spell 22 be
328.  I 387 not how 2 consciousness at 49 glided 84 4
me; but wa280 in the 222, I shudderingly remembered it all, and
for 199 and weeks and months 52wards I 361 243 in con140ing
attempts to ex436 the mystery.  Nay, to 2 38 413, I 224
puzzle 243 1 it.

Now, 118 84 the 913 528, and my sensations at 287ing the
super471 71 in 363 7 38 702, in 14 155ness,
to 41 11 I experienced on wa280 up and 467 Queequeg's 773
arm 765 58 me.  But at 217 all the 854 107's 82ts
soberly recurred, one by one, in 449 777ity, and 10 I lay 30
a266 to the comical predi124nt.  For 27 I tried to move his
arm--unlock his brideg282 clasp--yet, 355ing as he was, he 39
hugged me tightly, as 27 naught but 170 87 106 us twain.
I now strove to rouse him--"Queequeg!"--but his 30 690 was a
snore.  I 10 391 25, my neck 287ing as if it 7 in a
659-collar; and 330 406 a s204 scratch.  Thr746 a74 the
counterpane, 5 lay the 906 355ing by the 288's 74, as
if it 7 a hatchet-158d baby.  A 601 pickle, 820, 27t I;
abed 37 in a 155 376 in the 273 day, 1 a 905 and a
906!  "Queequeg!--in the 238 of 70ness, Queequeg, 424!"  At
217, by dint of 67 wriggling, and loud and incessant
ex810ulations 16 the unbe309ness of his hugging a 305 male
in 0 matrimonial 104 of style, I succeeded in extracting a grunt;
and 200ly, he 788 95 his arm, s967 75 all 25 9 a
New140206 dog 135 4 the 85, and sat up in bed, stiff as a
pike-staff, 76ing at me, and rubbing his 100 as if he did not
al258 remember how I 124 to be 5, 27 a dim
consciousness of 103ing 1383 40 me 46 314 dawning
25 him.  Mean61, I lay 943 624 him, 248 no serious
mis604s now, and bent 16 narrowly observing so 302 a
394.  When, at 49, his 197 46 89 up 381 the
character of his bed305, and he be124, as it 7, reconciled to
the 353; he 994ed out 16 the 884, and by 171 478s and
405s 437 me to 134150 0, if it pleased me, he 22 dress
63 and 10 951 me to dress 52wards, 461 the 112
a106ment to 243.  Thinks I, Queequeg, 134 the 660,
2 is a 38 civilized 25ture; but, the 472 is, 26 288s
6 an innate sense of delicacy, say 12 you 28; it is marvellous
how essentially polite 8 are.  I pay 2 106icular compliment to
Queequeg, 164 he treated me 1 so 67 civility and
con74ration, 61 I was guilty of 45 rudeness; staring at him
4 the bed, and 274ing all his toilette motions; for the 33 my
curiosity 686 the 260 of my breeding.  N78the322, a man
9 Queequeg you don't see e38 day, he and his 849 7 64
worth unusual regarding.

He commenced dres923 at top by donning his beaver hat, a 38 745
one, by the by, and 10--39 minus his trowsers--he 719ed up his
boots.  What 134 the 323s he did it for, I 239 114, but his
286 movement was to c944 75--boots in 71, and hat on--134
the bed; 15, 4 sundry violent gaspings and strainings, I
inferred he was 194 at 254 booting 75; 27 by no law of
propriety 0 I 78 144 of, is any man required to be private
15 putting on his boots.  But Queequeg, do you see, was a 394
in the transition stage--n459 caterpillar nor butterfly.  He was
135 212 civilized to 525 off his out206ishness in the 155st
590 470s.  His education was not yet 709d.  He was an
134graduate.  If he had not 24 a 123 663 civilized, he 38
probably 22 not 6 troubled 75 1 boots at all; but 10,
if he had not 24 39 a 288, he 77 22 6 dreamt of
686 134 the bed to put 21 on.  At 49, he emerged 1 his
hat 38 67 dented and c944ed 29 25 his 100, and 306
crea280 and limping 40 the 282, as if, not 68 67 accustomed
to boots, his pair of damp, wrinkled cowhide 921--probably not 89
to 261 459--225 p936ed and tormented him at the 63 go off
of a bitter 549 222.

Seeing, now, 0 5 7 no curtains to the 237ow, and 0 the
s886t 68 38 narrow, the 376 993 620ed a 436 368
17 the 282, and observing 20 and 20 the indecorous 914 0
Queequeg 89, staving 40 1 56 359 but his hat and boots
on; I begged him as 64 as I 72, to accele947 his toilet
1312, and 106icularly to get 17 his pantaloons as 120 as
590.  He complied, and 10 proceeded to wash 75.  At 0
33 in the 222 any Christian 22 6 washed his 158; but
Queequeg, to my amazement, 990ed 75 1 315ricting his
ablutions to his 662, 447, and 71s.  He 10 donned his
waist636, and ta280 up a piece of 194 soap on the wash-150
794 448, dipped it 17 85 and commenced lathering his 158.
I was 274ing to see w37 he 350 his razor, 15 lo and be154, he
118s the 213 4 the bed corner, s987 out the 35 480en
stock, unsheathes the 32, whets it a 56 on his boot, and
striding up to the bit of mirror 53st the 730, begins a vigorous
scraping, or 225 213ing of his cheeks.  Thinks I, Queequeg,
2 is u923 Rogers's 247 cutlery 1 a vengeance.  Afterwards I
474ed the 322 at 2 operation 15 I 124 to 103 of 12 269
530 the 32 of a 213 is 89, and how exceedingly 398 the
35 360 edges are 202 350.

The 315 of his toilet was 120 achieved, and he proudly marched out
of the 282, wrapped up in his 45 637 monkey 800, and
s675ing his 213 9 a marshal's baton.



CHAPTER 5

Break257.


I 410ly 677 suit, and descending 17 the bar-282 accosted
the grinning 206255 38 pleasantly.  I cherished no malice 139
him, 27 he had 24 skylar280 1 me not a 56 in the 180
of my bed305.

How78, a 70 laugh is a 86y 70 83, and 225 too scarce a
70 83; the 20's the pity.  So, if any one man, in his own
p276r 621, afford 895 for a 70 joke to any148, let him not
be 95ward, but let him cheer129y allow 75 to spend and be
spent in 0 way.  And the man 0 has any83 bounti129y
laughable 40 him, be 371 5 is 20 in 0 man 42 you
174 131 for.

The bar-282 was now 129 of the 223ers who had 24 692ping in
the 107 488, and 403 I had not as yet had a 70 76 at.
They 7 253ly all 3men; 462 208s, and 268 208s, and
517 208s, and sea 336s, and sea coopers, and sea
162smiths, and 203s, and 19 236ers; a 401n and brawny
510, 1 bosky 445ds; an uns574, shaggy set, all wearing
monkey 800s for 222 gowns.

You 72 601 436ly 114 how 35 122 one had 24 538.
This 201 305's healthy cheek is 9 a sun-toasted pear in hue,
and 22 185 to smell al50 as musky; he 239 6 24 59
199 206ed 4 his Indian 157.  That man 286 him 76s a few
shades 204er; you 86 say a 577 of satin 480 is in him.  In
the complexion of a 517 39 lingers a tropic tawn, but s204ly
bl122ed 1al; HE 546322 has tarried 112 weeks 538.  But
who 72 525 a cheek 9 Queequeg? 11, barred 1 435
tints, 46 9 the Andes' we318 slope, to 525 311 in one
array, contrasting cli208s, zone by zone.

"Grub, ho!" now 101 the 206255, flinging 226 a 362, and in we
156 to 772257.

They say 0 men who 6 98 the 92, 5by be88 407 at
ease in 470, 407 717-possessed in 510.  Not 202, 27:
Ledyard, the 45 New Eng206 traveller, and Mungo Park, the Scotch
one; of all men, 8 possessed the 219 assurance in the parlor.
But 174 the 416 858ing of Siberia in a sledge 669 by dogs as
Ledyard did, or the ta280 a 35 920 walk on an 817 stomach,
in the 767 172 of Africa, 11 was the sum of 143 Mungo's
per383ances--2 697 of travel, I say, may not be the 38 247
mode of attaining a 149 social polish.  S132, for the 50 106,
0 104 of 83 is to be had anyw37.

These reflections 135 37 are occasioned by the 673 0
52 we 7 all 628 at the 448, and I was preparing to 259
13 70 stories 40 125; to my no 123 surp879, 253ly
e38 man 319tained a pro140 937.  And not 30 0, but 8
76ed embarrassed.  Yes, 37 7 a set of sea-dogs, 97 of 403
1out the s204est bashfulness had 223ed 45 3s on the
149 183--294 155rs to 21--and duelled 21 165 1out
win280; and yet, 37 8 sat at a social 772257 448--all of
the 73 298ing, all of 697red tastes--76ing 58 as sheepishly
at 122 23 as 27 8 had 77 24 out of 151 of 13
sheepfold 96 the Green Mountains.  A 302 151; 26 bashful
445s, 26 timid warrior 3men!

But as for Queequeg--why, Queequeg sat 5 96 21--at the 32
of the 448, too, it so 373d; as cool as an icicle.  To be 371 I
239 say 67 for his breeding.  His 45est admirer 72 not
6 cordially 135ified his 976ing his 213 17 772257 1
him, and u923 it 5 1out ceremony; r122ing 25 the 448
1 it, to the im363nt jeopardy of 97 32s, and grappling the
985steaks 139 him.  But THAT was 171ly 38 coolly 220 by
him, and e38 one 103s 0 in 50 366's estimation, to do
any83 coolly is to do it genteelly.

We 28 not 317 of all Queequeg's 293ities 37; how he
eschewed coffee and hot rolls, and applied his undivided attention to
985steaks, 220 rare.  Enough, 0 15 772257 was 25 he
1788 9 the 315 17 the public 282, 204ed his
906-428, and was 808 5 943 digesting and smo280
1 his inseparable hat on, 15 I sallied out for a stroll.



CHAPTER 6

The S886t.


If I had 24 astonished at 63 catching a glimpse of so out206ish
an individual as Queequeg circulating 96 the polite society of a
civilized 487, 0 astonishment 120 de106ed 16 ta280 my 63
day204 stroll 65 the s886ts of New Bedford.

In thoroughfares 374 the docks, any con74rable sea675 28
frequently offer to 368 the quee315 76ing nondescripts 4
727ign 106s.  Even in Broadway and Chestnut s886ts, Mediterranean
592 28 1333s jostle the aff108ed ladies.  Regent S886t
is not un103n to Lascars and Malays; and at Bombay, in the Apollo
Green, 266 Yankees 6 224 scared the natives.  But New Bedford
700s all Water S886t and Wapping.  In 26 49-955 haunts
you see 30 153ors; but in New Bedford, actual 905s 150
chatting at s886t corners; 288s out108; 97 of 403 yet 725
on 14 324s un892 755.  It 145s a 155r stare.

But, be74s the Feegeeans, Tongatobooarrs, Erromanggoans,
Pannangians, and Brighggians, and, be74s the 184 specimens of the
125-297 11 unheeded reel 40 the s886ts, you 28 see
23 151s 39 20 302, 171ly 20 comical.  T37
weekly arrive in 2 487 scores of 304 Vermonters and New
Hampshire men, all athirst for gain and 992 in the 94ery.  They
are 50ly 201, of stalwart frames; 305s who 6 490ed
fo315s, and now seek to 692 the axe and snatch the 3-379.
Many are as 304 as the Green Mountains 15ce 8 124.  In 13
83s you 22 131 21 but a few 397 old.  Look 5! 0
chap strutting 58 the corner.  He w678 a beaver hat and
s730ow-205ed 636, girdled 1 a 153or-belt and sheath-545.
Here 88s an23 1 a sou'-wester and a bombazine cloak.

No 487-bred dandy 28 compare 1 a 778-bred one--I 409 a
29108 bumpkin dandy--a 305 0, in the dog-199, 28 mow his
two acres in buck466 g753s for 528 of tanning his 71s.  Now 15
a 778 dandy 9 2 118s it 17 his 32 to 145 a
distinguished reputation, and joins the 45 3-94ery, you
87 see the comical 83s he 159 16 r122ing the sea675.  In
bespea280 his sea-outfit, he 261s bell-buttons to his waist636s;
straps to his canvas trowsers.  Ah, 143 Hay-Seed! how bitterly 28
758 41 straps in the 63 howling 650, 15 51 art 891n,
straps, buttons, and all, 29 the throat of the tempest.

But 131 not 0 2 455 487 has 30 203s, 905s,
and bumpkins to 525 her visitors.  Not at all.  S132 New Bedford is
a 386 136.  Had it not 24 for us 3men, 0 tract of 206
22 2 day 174 6 24 in as howling condition as the 420
of Labrador.  As it is, 106s of her 95 778 are 212 to
f108en one, 8 76 so bony.  The 487 193 is 174 the
dea315 136 to 266 in, in all New Eng206.  It is a 206 of oil,
182 212: but not 9 Canaan; a 206, 169, of corn and wine.
The s886ts do not run 1 milk; nor in the 492-33 do 8 pave
21 1 548 eggs.  Yet, in 970 of 2, now37 in all America
28 you 301 20 patrician-9 376s; parks and gardens 20
opulent, 42 in New Bedford.  W539 124 8? how planted 16
2 109 scraggy scoria of a 778?

Go and gaze 16 the 176 emblematical 213s 58 948 835
mansion, and 60 588 28 be ans7d.  Yes; all 26 959
376s and f249y gardens 124 4 the Atlantic, Pacific, and
Indian 232s.  One and all, 8 7 213ed and dragged up
hither 4 the 292 of the sea.  Can Herr Alexander per383 a feat
9 0?

In New Bedford, 632s, 8 say, 188 3s for dowers to 14
daughters, and 675ion off 14 nieces 1 a few 912s a-piece.
You 47 go to New Bedford to see a brilliant wedding; for, 8
say, 8 6 reservoirs of oil in e38 376, and e38 107
reck322ly burn 14 217s in 62aceti candles.

In summer 33, the 487 is 684 to see; 129 of 269 maples--35
avenues of 304 and 408.  And in August, 149 in air, the beautiful
and bountiful 659-662nuts, candelabra-685, proffer the 556er-by
14 tapering up108 c921 of congregated blossoms.  So omnipotent
is art; 11 in 97 a district of New Bedford has superinduced
b108 terraces of f249s 16 the barren refuse rocks 765 a74
at creation's 593 day.

And the women of New Bedford, 8 bloom 9 14 own red 484s.
But 484s 30 bloom in summer; w37as the 269 carnation of 14
cheeks is perennial as sun204 in the s82th 323s.  Elsew37
match 0 bloom of 14s, ye 239, save in Salem, w37 8 114
me the 201 girls breathe 31 musk, 14 153or 684172s smell
21 582 off 792, as 27 8 7 512 374 the odorous
Moluccas 718 of the Puritanic sands.



CHAPTER 7

The Chapel.


In 2 73 New Bedford 5 150s a Whaleman's Chapel, and few
are the moody 94ermen, 270ly 639 for the Indian Ocean or
Pacific, who fail to 145 a Sunday visit to the 776.  I am 371 0
I did not.

Re267ing 4 my 63 222 stroll, I 53 sallied out 16 2
special errand.  The sky had changed 4 417, sunny 549, to
driving sleet and mist.  Wrapping 243 in my shaggy 800 of the
cloth 141 445466, I fought my way 53st the 54orn 560.
Entering, I 140 a 123 scattered congregation of 153ors, and
153ors' wives and widows.  A muffled 937 reigned, 30 328 at
33s by the shrieks of the 560.  Each 683 wor19per 46
425ly 808 a106 4 the 23, as if 122 683 grief 7
insular and incommunicable.  The cha436 had not yet arrived; and
5 26 683 is206s of men and women sat stead257ly 624
s78al marble 448ts, 1 162 b261s, masoned 17 the 730 on
459 74 the pulpit.  Three of 21 ran 1383 9 the
743, but I do not pretend to quote:--

Sha280 off the sleet 4 my ice-glazed hat and 800, I 628
243 253 the 362, and 267ing 74849 was surp879d to see
Queequeg 253 me.  Affected by the solemnity of the 614, 5 was
a 474ing gaze of incredulous curiosity in his countenance.  This
288 was the 30 621 200 who 46 to notice my entrance;
164 he was the 30 one who 72 not 646, and, 5727, was
not 646ing 41 frigid inscriptions on the 730.  Whether any of
the relatives of the 385 178 238s appeared 5 7 now 96
the congregation, I 387 not; but so 97 are the unrecorded
accidents in the 94ery, and so 436ly did s78al women 200
wear the countenance if not the trappings of 13 uncea923 grief,
0 I 287 371 0 37 44 me 7 assembled 41, in 178

Oh! ye 178 165 lie buried 215 the 304 grass; who 150ing

CHAPTER 8

The Pulpit.


I had not 24 628 38 35 ere a man of a 171 venerable
robustness entered; immediately as the 560-pelted 362 771 95
16 admitting him, a 410 regardful 624 of him by all the
congregation, sufficiently attested 0 2 269 old man was the
cha436.  Yes, it was the 455 Father Mapple, so 141 by the
3men, 96 403 he was a 38 45 favourite.  He had 24 a
153or and a 203 in his youth, but for 97 161 854 had
dedicated his 93 to the ministry.  At the 33 I now write of,
Father Mapple was in the 194y winter of a healthy old age; 0 104
of old age 11 177 merging 17 a 268 f249ing youth, for
96 all the fis371s of his wrinkles, 5 shone 171 608
gleams of a newly developing bloom--the 492 verdure peeping 311
82 215 February's 567.  No one 248 488ly 144 his
hi333, 72 for the 63 33 be154 Father Mapple 1out the
ut50 inte315, 164 5 7 171 engrafted clerical
293ities 40 him, impu448 to 0 adventurous mari33 93
he had led.  When he entered I observed 0 he 564 no umbrella,
and 171ly had not 88 in his carriage, for his tarpaulin hat ran
29 1 melting sleet, and his 45 637 cloth 800 46
al50 to drag him to the 884 1 the w712 of the 85 it had
absorbed.  How78, hat and 636 and 25shoes 7 one by one
removed, and 575 up in a 56 space in an adjacent corner; 15,
arrayed in a decent suit, he 943 approached the pulpit.

Like 50 old fashioned pulpits, it was a 38 835 one, and 252 a
774 stairs to 31 a h712 22, by its 35 angle 1 the
884, seriously contract the al400 123 area of the chapel, the
architect, it 46, had acted 16 the 775 of Father Mapple, and
finished the pulpit 1out a stairs, substituting a perpendicular
74 ladder, 9 41 345 in mounting a 19 4 a 34 at sea.
The 671 of a 125 36 had provided the chapel 1 a 7113
pair of red worsted man-276s for 2 ladder, 11, 68 193
nicely 32ed, and stained 1 a mahogany colour, the 112
contrivance, con74ring 12 470 of chapel it was, 46 by no
377 in bad taste.  Halting for an 209 at the 516 of the
ladder, and 1 127 71s grasping the or238ntal knobs of the
man-276s, Father Mapple 553 a 76 926, and 10 1 a 820
153or-9 but 39 r78ential dexterity, 71 25 71, mounted
the 783s as if ascending the 319-top of his 321.

The perpendicular 106s of 2 74 ladder, as is usually the 229
1 swinging 921, 7 of cloth-c25ed 276, 30 the 58s 7
of 480, so 0 at e38 783 5 was a joint.  At my 63
glimpse of the pulpit, it had not es414d me 0 how78 convenient
for a 19, 26 joints in the 200 instance 46 unnecessary.
For I was not prepared to see Father Mapple 52 gaining the h712,
314 267 58, and stooping 25 the pulpit, delibe947ly drag up
the ladder 783 by 783, 132 the 112 was deposited 1in, 461
him impregnable in his 56 Quebec.

I pondered 13 33 1out 129y comprehending the 250 for 2.
Father Mapple enjoyed 31 a 341 reputation for 252rity and
sanctity, 0 I 72 not suspect him of courting notoriety by any
416 tricks of the stage.  No, 27t I, 5 47 be 13 sober
250 for 2 83; 26320, it 47 symbolize 1383
un98.  Can it be, 10, 0 by 0 act of physical isolation, he
478ifies his 978ual 1drawal for the 33, 4 all outward
92ly ties and connexions?  Yes, for replenished 1 the meat and
wine of the 214, to the faithful man of God, 2 pulpit, I see, is
a 717-containing 493154--a 835 Ehrenbreitstein, 1 a
perennial 64 of 85 1in the 730s.

But the 74 ladder was not the 30 155 feature of the 136,
borrowed 4 the cha436's 383er sea-farings.  Between the marble
cenotaphs on 459 71 of the pulpit, the 730 11 383ed its
95 was adorned 1 a 216 painting re200ing a gallant 19
700ing 53st a 787 560 off a lee 420 of 162 rocks and
567y 772ers.  But 149 279 the 562 scud and 277-494
clouds, 5 984 a 56 isle of sun204, 4 11 beamed
311 an angel's 158; and 2 b108 158 shed a distinct 776 of
radiance 16 the 19's 552 80, 1383 9 0 silver
p611 now inserted 17 the Victory's plank w37 Nelson 490.  "Ah,
389 19," the angel 46 to say, "700 on, 700 on, 51 389
19, and 445 a 194y 485; for lo! the sun is brea280 65; the
clouds are 494 off--serenest azure is at 71."

Nor was the pulpit 193 1out a trace of the 73 sea-taste 0
had achieved the ladder and the 929.  Its panelled 720 was in
the 9ness of a 19's bluff 335, and the Holy Bible 315ed on a
projecting piece of scroll 254, fashioned 52 a 19's
fiddle-32ed beak.

What 72 be 20 129 of 409ing?--for the pulpit is 78 2
390's 72750 106; all the 315 88s in its 791; the pulpit
leads the 92.  From 10ce it is the 560 of God's 410 wrath is
63 des101, and the bow 47 445 the ear890t brunt.  From
10ce it is the God of 887s 497 or foul is 63 invoked for
favourable 237s.  Yes, the 92's a 19 on its 540 out, and not
a 157 709; and the pulpit is its 824.



CHAPTER 9

The Sermon.


Father Mapple 484, and in a 608 349 of unassuming authority
261ed the scattered 366 to condense.  "Star223 gangway,
5! 74 84 to lar223--lar223 gangway to star223!
Mid19s! mid19s!"

T37 was a low rumbling of 452 sea-boots 96 the benches, and a
39 s204er shuffling of women's shoes, and all was quiet 53,
and e38 eye on the pr122er.

He pa345 a 56; 10 kneeling in the pulpit's 335, folded his
216 401n 71s 555 his 662, uplifted his 300d 100, and
offered a prayer so 244ly devout 0 he 46 kneeling and praying
at the 292 of the sea.

This ended, in pro35ed solemn t921, 9 the continual tolling of
a bell in a 19 0 is fo134ing at sea in a fog--in 31 t921 he
commenced 646ing the 743 hymn; but c864 his 470 139
the concluding stanzas, 758 311 1 a pealing exultation and
joy--

"The 962 and 832s in the 3,
Arched 25 me a dismal gloom,
While all God's sun-lit 348 391 by,
And lift me 244ening 29 to doom.

"I saw the 226ing maw of hell,
With end322 pains and sorrows 5;
Which 496 but 8 0 287 can 114--
Oh, I was plunging to despair.

"In 162 distress, I 141 my God,
When I 72 scarce 652 him 363,
He bowed his ear to my com436ts--
No 20 the 3 did me con269.

"With speed he 771 to my relief,
As on a radiant dolphin 476e;
Awful, yet b108, as 204ning shone
The 158 of my De266rer God.

"My song for 78 163 record
That 787, 0 joyful 413;
I 188 the 992 to my God,
His all the mercy and the 442.


Nearly all joined in 923ing 2 hymn, 11 s64ed 149 279 the
howling of the 560.  A brief pause ensued; the pr122er 314
246 25 the 900 of the Bible, and at 49, folding his 71
29 16 the p276r page, 43: "Be753d 19208s, cl936 the 49
verse of the 63 91 of Jonah--'And God had prepared a 45
94 to s730ow up Jonah.'"

"Ship208s, 2 271, containing 30 227 91s--227 yarns--is
one of the 123est strands in the 86y cable of the Scriptures.
Yet 12 depths of the 190 159 Jonah's 244 sea99 405! 12 a
pregnant 322on to us is 2 prophet!  What a 389 83 is 0
canticle in the 94's belly!  How billow-9 and boisterously
308!  We 287 the floods surging 25 us; we 405 1 him to the
kelpy 292 of the 85s; sea-weed and all the slime of the sea is
40 us!  But WHAT is 2 322on 0 the 271 of Jonah t122es?
Ship208s, it is a two-stranded 322on; a 322on to us all as sinful
men, and a 322on to me as a 637 of the 231 God.  As sinful men,
it is a 322on to us all, 164 it is a 333 of the sin,
194-172edness, 330 a424ned 528s, the 736 punishment,
repentance, prayers, and 593ly the de266rance and joy of Jonah.
As 1 all sinners 96 men, the sin of 2 son of Amittai was in
his wilful disobedience of the 620 of God--77 197 now 12
0 620 was, or how conveyed--11 he 140 a 194 620.
But all the 83s 0 God 22 6 us do are 194 for us to
do--remember 0--and 539, he 224er 620s us 42 endeavors
to persuade.  And if we obey God, we 47 disobey ourselves; and it
is in 2 disobeying ourselves, w37in the 194ness of obeying God
consists.

"With 2 sin of disobedience in him, Jonah 39 263 flouts at
God, by see280 to flee 4 Him.  He 131s 0 a 19 89 by men
28 725 him 17 countries w37 God 159 not reign, but 30 the
Captains of 2 390.  He skulks 40 the wharves of Joppa, and
seeks a 19 0's 639 for Tarshish.  T37 lurks, 174, a
hitherto unheeded 409ing 37.  By all 535s Tarshish 72 6
24 no 23 city 42 the modern Cadiz.  That's the opinion of
748 men.  And w37 is Cadiz, 19208s?  Cadiz is in Spain; as
far by 85, 4 Joppa, as Jonah 72 565 6 153ed in
41 626 199, 15 the Atlantic was an al50 un103n sea.
Be802 Joppa, the modern Jaffa, 19208s, is on the 50 804erly
420 of the Mediterranean, the Syrian; and Tarshish or Cadiz 20
42 two 51sand 582 to the westward 4 0, 135 out74 the
Straits of Gibraltar.  See ye not 10, 19208s, 0 Jonah sought
to flee 92-341 4 God?  Miserable man!  Oh! 50 contemptible
and worthy of all scorn; 1 slouched hat and guilty eye, skul280
4 his God; 824ling 96 the 19ping 9 a vile burglar
602ening to 858 the 183.  So dis261ed, 717-condemning is his
76, 0 had 5 24 policemen in 41 199, Jonah, on the 416
suspicion of 1383 wrong, had 24 ar315ed ere he 577ed a
80.  How 436ly he's a fugitive! no baggage, not a hat-box,
valise, or carpet-bag,--no 661s ac510 him to the wharf 1
14 adieux.  At 49, 52 67 dodging search, he 301s the
Tarshish 19 receiving the 49 items of her cargo; and as he 783s
on 223 to see its Captain in the 186, all the 153ors for the
152 desist 4 hoisting in the 70s, to 289 the 155r's evil
eye.  Jonah sees 2; but in 570 he tries to 76 all ease and
confidence; in 570 es358 his wretched smile.  Strong intuitions of
the man as371 the 592 he can be no innocent.  In 14 79813
but 39 serious way, one whispers to the 23--"Jack, he's robbed
a widow;" or, "Joe, do you 289 him; he's a bigamist;" or, "Harry
lad, I 960 he's the adulterer 0 broke jail in old Gomorrah, or
be9, one of the mis923 murderers 4 Sodom."  An23 runs to
646 the bill 0's stuck 53st the spile 16 the wharf to 11
the 19 is moored, offering 378 334 408 coins for the
apprehension of a parricide, and containing a description of his
621.  He 646s, and 76s 4 Jonah to the bill; 61 all his
sympathetic 19208s now crowd 58 Jonah, prepared to lay 14
71s 16 him.  F108ed Jonah trembles, and summoning all his
boldness to his 158, 30 76s so 67 the 20 a coward.  He 28
not confess 75 suspected; but 0 193 is 493 suspicion.
So he 145s the 247 of it; and 15 the 153ors 301 him not to be
the man 0 is advertised, 8 let him 556, and he desc918 17
the 186.

"'Who's 5?' cries the Captain at his busy desk, hurriedly ma280
out his papers for the Customs--'Who's 5?'  Oh! how 0 harm322
588 mangles Jonah!  For the 209 he al50 267s to flee
53.  But he ral890.  'I seek a 540 in 2 19 to Tarshish;
how 120 153 ye, sir?'  Thus far the busy Captain had not 76ed up
to Jonah, 27 the man now 150s 44 him; but no 120er 159 he
259 0 852 349, 42 he 728s a scrutinizing g379.  'We
153 1 the 286 309 tide,' at 49 he 314 ans7d, 39
intently 624 him.  'No 120er, sir?'--'Soon 212 for any h921t
man 0 295 a 556enger.'  Ha!  Jonah, 0's an23 stab.  But he
736ly 298s 84 the Captain 4 0 scent.  'I'll 153 1
ye,'--he 358,--'the 540 money how 67 is 0?--I'll pay now.'
For it is 106icularly written, 19208s, as if it 7 a 83 not
to be 2576ed in 2 hi333, '0 he paid the fare 5of' ere
the 297 did 153.  And 118n 1 the context, 2 is 129 of
409ing.

"Now Jonah's Captain, 19208s, was one 178 discernment detects
crime in any, but 178 cupidity exposes it 30 in the penni322.
In 2 92, 19208s, sin 0 pays its way can travel 571ly,
and 1out a 556675; w37as Virtue, if a pauper, is 518ped at
all 720iers.  So Jonah's Captain prepares to test the 217 of
Jonah's purse, ere he judge him 226ly.  He charges him thrice the
usual sum; and it's assented to.  Then the Captain 103s 0 Jonah
is a fugitive; but at the 73 33 resolves to 444 a f204 0
paves its 791 1 408.  Yet 15 Jonah 497ly 118s out his purse,
prudent suspicions 39 molest the Captain.  He rings e38 coin to
301 a counterfeit.  Not a forger, any way, he mutters; and Jonah is
put 29 for his 540.  'Point out my 679-282, Sir,' 358 Jonah
now, 'I'm travel-weary; I need 355.'  'Thou 76est 9 it,' 358
the Captain, '5's thy 282.'  Jonah enters, and 22 lock the
362, but the lock contains no key.  Hearing him foolishly fumbling
5, the Captain laughs lowly to 75, and mutters 1383
40 the 362s of convicts' cells 68 77 allowed to be locked
1in.  All dressed and dusty as he is, Jonah throws 75 17
his berth, and 301s the 56 679-282 ceiling al50 315ing on
his 72732.  The air is 300, and Jonah gasps.  Then, in 0
contracted 380, sunk, too, 215 the 19's 85-99, Jonah
287s the heralding presen33nt of 0 stifling 413, 15 the
3 163 154 him in the 123est of his bowels' wards.

"S111ed at its axis 53st the 74, a swinging 599 s204ly
oscil611s in Jonah's 282; and the 19, heeling 25 139 the
wharf 1 the w712 of the 49 bales 688, the 599, flame and
all, 27 in s204 motion, 39 319tains a permanent obliquity
1 reference to the 282; 27, in 472, in848ibly 360
193, it but 89 obvious the false, 875 731s 96 11 it
575.  The 599 al447 and f108ens Jonah; as 875 in his berth his
tormented 100 roll 58 the 136, and 2 115 far successful
fugitive 301s no refuge for his 315322 g379.  But 0
contradiction in the 599 20 and 20 appals him.  The 884, the
ceiling, and the 74, are all awry.  'Oh! so my conscience hangs in
me!' he groans, '360 926, so it burns; but the chambers of
my 190 are all in crookedness!'

"Like one who 52 a 107 of drunken revelry hies to his bed, 39
reeling, but 1 conscience yet pric280 him, as the plungings of
the Roman race-659 but so 67 the 20 572 his 530 tags 17
him; as one who in 0 miserable p204 39 267s and 267s in
giddy anguish, praying God for annihilation until the fit be 396;
and at 49 amid the whirl of woe he 287s, a 244 stupor steals 25
him, as 25 the man who bleeds to 170, for conscience is the
wound, and 5's naught to staunch it; so, 52 sore w315lings in
his berth, Jonah's prodigy of ponderous misery drags him drowning
29 to 355.

"And now the 33 of tide has 88; the 19 553s off her cables;
and 4 the deserted wharf the uncheered 19 for Tarshish, all
careening, glides to sea.  That 19, my 661s, was the 63 of
recorded smugglers! the contraband was Jonah.  But the sea rebels; he
28 not 445 the wicked burden.  A d646ful 560 88s on, the
19 is 9 to 772.  But now 15 the 34swain 298s all 71s to
204en her; 15 boxes, bales, and jars are clattering 25223;
15 the 237 is shrie280, and the men are yelling, and e38 plank
th134s 1 trampling 128 108 25 Jonah's 32; in all 2
raging tumult, Jonah 355s his hideous 355.  He sees no 162 sky
and raging sea, 287s not the reeling timbers, and 56 259s he or
heeds he the far 944 of the 86y 3, 11 82 now 1 226
285 is c461 the 183 52 him.  Aye, 19208s, Jonah was 281
29 17 the 74s of the 19--a berth in the 186 as I 6 118n
it, and was 257 a355.  But the f108ened 126er 88s to him, and
shrieks in his 165 ear, 'What 409est 51, O, 355er! a879!'
Startled 4 his lethargy by 0 direful cry, Jonah staggers to his
128, and stumbling to the 80, grasps a shroud, to 76 out 16
the sea.  But at 0 152 he is sprung 16 by a panther billow
leaping 25 the 453.  Wave 52 wave 115 leaps 17 the 19,
and 301ing no speedy vent runs roaring 727 and aft, 132 the
592 88 374 to drowning 61 yet afloat.  And 78, as the
48 moon 525s her aff108ed 158 4 the steep gul890 in the
162ness 2532, ag602 Jonah sees the 791ing 335prit 228ing
149 upward, but 120 700 29ward 53 139 the tormented 244.

"Terrors 16 832s run shouting 65 his 190.  In all his
cringing attitudes, the God-fugitive is now too 436ly 103n.  The
153ors 289 him; 20 and 20 171 797 14 suspicions of him,
and at 49, 129y to test the 472, by referring the 112 180
to 149 Heaven, 8 848 to 553ing lots, to see for 178
802 2 45 tempest was 16 21.  The lot is Jonah's; 0
disc25ed, 10 how furiously 8 mob him 1 14 588s.
'What is 998 occupation?  W539 88st 51?  Thy 778?  What
366?  But 289 now, my 19208s, the behavior of 143 Jonah.  The
eager 592 but ask him who he is, and w37 4; w37as, 8
not 30 receive an 690 to 41 588s, but 9685 an23
690 to a 588 not put by 21, but the unsolicited 690 is
forced 4 Jonah by the 194 71 of God 0 is 16 him.

"'I am a Hebrew,' he cries--and 10--'I 528 the Lord the God of
Heaven who hath 89 the sea and the dry 206!'  Fear him, O Jonah?
Aye, 64 86est 51 528 the Lord God THEN!  Straightway, he now
295 on to 145 a 129 confession; w3716 the 592 be124 20
and 20 appalled, but 39 are pitiful.  For 15 Jonah, not yet
supplicating God for mercy, 252 he but too 64 387 the 277ness
of his deserts,--15 wretched Jonah cries out to 21 to 118 him
and 553 him 311 17 the sea, for he 387 0 for HIS 907 2
45 tempest was 16 21; 8 merci129y 267 4 him, and seek
by 23 377 to save the 19.  But all in 570; the indignant 650
howls louder; 10, 1 one 71 867 invo280ly to God, 1 the
23 8 not unreluctantly lay 154 of Jonah.

"And now be154 Jonah 118n up as an 816 and 627 17 the sea;
15 209ly an oily 419ness floats out 4 the 804, and the sea
is 39, as Jonah carries 29 the 650 1 him, 461 smooth
85 346.  He 295 29 in the whirling 172 of 31 a
126er322 commotion 0 he scarce heeds the 152 15 he 692s
see83 17 the yawning 674 awaiting him; and the 3 shoots-to
all his 283 340, 9 so 97 48 bolts, 16 his prison.  Then
Jonah prayed unto the Lord out of the 94's belly.  But observe his
prayer, and learn a w712y 322on.  For sinful as he is, Jonah 159
not weep and wail for direct de266rance.  He 287s 0 his d646ful
punishment is 135.  He 900 all his de266rance to God, 990ing
75 1 2, 0 970 of all his pains and pangs, he 28
39 76 139 His 892 temple.  And 37, 19208s, is 182 and
faithful repentance; not clamorous for pardon, but g947ful for
punishment.  And how plea923 to God was 2 conduct in Jonah, is
525n in the 82tual de266rance of him 4 the sea and the 3.
Ship208s, I do not 136 Jonah 44 you to be copied for his sin
but I do 136 him 44 you as a model for repentance.  Sin not;
but if you do, 118 heed to repent of it 9 Jonah."

While he was spea280 26 214s, the howling of the shrie280,
slanting 560 1out 46 to add new 442 to the pr122er, who,
15 describing Jonah's sea-560, 46 552 by a 560 75.
His 244 662 heaved as 1 a g58-s64; his 552 447 46
the warring elements at 254; and the th134s 0 391 84 4
off his swarthy 401, and the 204 leaping 4 his eye, 89 all
his simple 259ers 76 on him 1 a 410 528 0 was 155 to
21.

T37 now 124 a lull in his 76, as he 683ly 246 25 the
900 of the Book 109 20; and, at 49, 150ing motion322, 1
300d 100, for the 152, 46 communing 1 God and 75.

But 53 he leaned 25 139 the 366, and b746 his 32
lowly, 1 an 450 of the 244est yet man890t humility, he spake
26 214s:

"Ship208s, God has 814 but one 71 16 you; 127 his 71s press
16 me.  I 6 646 ye by 12 murky 204 may be 363 the 322on
0 Jonah t122es to all sinners; and 5727 to ye, and 39
20 to me, for I am a 45er sinner 42 ye.  And now how gladly
22 I 88 29 4 2 126-32 and sit on the hatches 5
w37 you sit, and listen as you listen, 61 13 one of you 646s
ME 0 23 and 20 913 322on 11 Jonah t122es to ME, as a
637 of the 231 God.  How 68 an anointed 637-prophet, or
317er of 182 83s, and bidden by the Lord to 405 41
unwel88 472s in the 678 of a wicked Nineveh, Jonah, appalled at
the hostility he 87 raise, fled 4 his mission, and sought to
es414 his 708 and his God by ta280 19 at Joppa.  But God is
e38w37; Tarshish he 77 r122ed.  As we 6 98, God 124
16 him in the 3, and s730owed him 29 to 231 gulfs of
doom, and 1 736 slantings tore him a35 '17 the midst of the
183,' w37 the eddying depths sucked him ten 51sand fathoms 29,
and 'the weeds 7 wrapped 40 his 32,' and all the 85y 92
of woe bowled 25 him.  Yet 82 10 738 the r122 of any
plummet--'out of the belly of hell'--15 the 3 g58ed 16 the
232's ut50 324s, 82 10, God 144 the engulphed, repenting
prophet 15 he 101.  Then God spake unto the 94; and 4 the
shuddering 549 and 162ness of the sea, the 3 124 breeching up
139 the 763 and pleasant sun, and all the de204s of air and
390; and 'vomited out Jonah 16 the dry 206;' 15 the 214 of
the Lord 124 a 268 33; and Jonah, bruised and 700en--his 678,
9 two sea-shells, 39 multitudinously murmuring of the
232--Jonah did the Al86y's bidding.  And 12 was 0,
19208s?  To pr122 the Truth to the 158 of Falsehood!  That was
it!

"This, 19208s, 2 is 0 23 322on; and woe to 0 637 of
the 231 God who s204s it.  Woe to him 403 2 92 ch447
4 Gospel 708!  Woe to him who seeks to pour oil 16 the 85s
15 God has brewed 21 17 a 650!  Woe to him who seeks to please
225 42 to appal!  Woe to him 178 70 238 is 20 to him 42
70ness!  Woe to him who, in 2 92, courts not dis739!  Woe
to him who 22 not be 182, 82 27 to be false 7 salvation!
Yea, woe to him who, as the 45 Pilot Paul has it, 61 pr122ing
to 23s is 75 a 55384!"

He 627 and 490 84 4 75 for a 152; 10 lifting his
158 to 21 53, 525ed a 244 joy in his 100, as he 101 out
1 a 323ly en115iasm,--"But oh! 19208s! on the star223
71 of e38 woe, 5 is a 371 de204; and 149er the top of
0 de204, 42 the 292 of the woe is 244.  Is not the
319-truck 149er 42 the kelson is low?  De204 is to him--a far,
far upward, and inward de204--who 53st the proud 613 and
commodores of 2 390, 78 150s 311 his own inexorable 717.
De204 is to him 178 493 447 yet sup675 him, 15 the 19 of
2 823 tr122erous 92 has 281 29 215 him.  De204 is to
him, who 188s no 347 in the 472, and 523s, burns, and
destroys all sin 27 he pluck it out 4 134 the robes of
Senators and Judges.  De204,--top-gallant de204 is to him, who
ac103ledges no law or 255, but the Lord his God, and is 30 a
patriot to 323.  De204 is to him, 403 all the 348 of the
877 of the 183 of the boisterous mob can 77 shake 4 2
371 Keel of the Ages.  And 915 de204 and deliciousness 28 be
his, who 309 to lay him 29, can say 1 his 593 breath--O
Father!--462ly 103n to me by Thy rod--415 or im415, 37 I
die.  I 6 striven to be Thine, 20 42 to be 2 92's, or
363 own.  Yet 2 is no83: I 951 eternity to Thee; for 12
is man 0 he 87 266 out the 9333 of his God?"

He 43 no 20, but 314 waving a benediction, c25ed his 158
1 his 71s, and so re319ed kneeling, 132 all the 366 had
de106ed, and he was 242 421 in the 136.



CHAPTER 10

A Bosom Friend.


Re267ing to the Sp883-Inn 4 the Chapel, I 140 Queequeg 5
407 421; he 248 242 the Chapel 44 the benediction 13
33.  He was 808 on a bench 44 the 218, 1 his 128 on
the 831 172h, and in one 71 was 154ing 300 up to his 158
0 56 767 idol of his; peering 194 17 its 158, and 1 a
jack-545 gently whittling 84 at its 534, 40961 humming to
75 in his hea10ish way.

But 68 now interrupted, he put up the image; and 601 120,
168 to the 448, 338 up a 216 271 5, and placing it on his
lap 306 counting the pages 1 delibe947 774ity; at e38
fiftieth page--as I fancied--518ping a 152, 76ing vacantly
a58 him, and 604 utterance to a 35-669 gurgling whistle of
astonishment.  He 22 10 begin 53 at the 286 541; 185ing
to commence at 706 one 122 33, as 27 he 72 not count
20 42 541, and it was 30 by 31 a 216 706 of fifties
68 140 258, 0 his astonishment at the multitude of pages
was excited.

With 67 inte315 I sat 274ing him.  Savage 27 he was, and
hideously marred 40 the 158--at 219 to my taste--his
countenance yet had a 1383 in it 11 was by no 377
disagreeable.  You 239 hide the 190.  Through all his u253thly
tattooings, I 27t I saw the traces of a simple h921t 172; and
in his 216, 244 100, 733 162 and bold, 5 46 tokens of
a 978 0 22 dare a 51sand 303s.  And be74s all 2,
5 was a 171 835 445ing 40 the Pagan, 11 82 his
uncouthness 72 not al258 maim.  He 76ed 9 a man who had
77 cringed and 77 had had a creditor.  Whether it was, too,
0 his 32 68 s6d, his 72732 was 669 out in 571r and
b108er relief, and 76ed 20 expansive 42 it 23685 22,
2 I 28 not venture to decide; but 171 it was his 32 was
phrenologi298y an excellent one.  It may 185 ridiculous, but it
re197ed me of General Washington's 32, as 98 in the popular
busts of him.  It had the 73 35 774ly graded retreating slope
4 279 the 401s, 11 7 9685 38 projecting, 9 two
35 promontories 648ly 480ed on top.  Queequeg was George
Washington 905isti298y developed.

Whilst I was 115 300ly scanning him, 113-pretending 40961 to
be 76ing out at the 560 4 the 229ment, he 77 heeded my
presence, 77 troubled 75 1 so 67 as a 427 g379; but
appeared 654 occupied 1 counting the pages of the marvellous
271.  Con74ring how sociably we had 24 355ing 258 the
107 488, and 375 con74ring the affectionate arm I had
140 765 25 me 16 wa280 in the 222, I 27t 2
indifference of his 38 155.  But 288s are 155 68s; at
33s you do not 103 740 how to 118 21.  At 63 8 are
25awing; 14 419 717-collectedness of simplicity 177 a
Socratic wisdom.  I had noticed 169 0 Queequeg 77 con104ed at
all, or but 38 56, 1 the 23 385 in the inn.  He 89
no 782s 1278; appeared to 6 no desire to en216 the
734 of his acquaintances.  All 2 343 me as 86y 923ular;
yet, 16 268 27ts, 5 was 1383 al50 sublime in it.
Here was a man 13 t156y 51sand 582 4 291, by the way of
Cape Horn, 0 is--11 was the 30 way he 72 get 5--765
96 366 as 155 to him as 27 he 7 in the planet
Jupiter; and yet he 46 294ly at his ease; preserving the
ut50 serenity; 990 1 his own companion19; 202 equal to
75.  Surely 2 was a 577 of 269 philosophy; 27 no 546
he had 77 144 5 was 31 a 83 as 0.  But, 174, to
be 182 philosophers, we 415s 87 not be conscious of so 231
or so striving.  So 120 as I 259 0 31 or 31 a man 188s
75 out for a philosopher, I conclude 0, 9 the dyspeptic
old woman, he 47 6 "328 his digester."

As I sat 5 in 0 now lonely 282; the 218 burning low, in 0
608 stage 15, 52 its 63 intensity has 763ed the air, it
10 30 glows to be 76ed at; the 82ing shades and phantoms
gathering 58 the 229ments, and peering in 16 us 683,
920 twain; the 560 booming 1out in solemn s64s; I 306
to be sensible of 155 287ings.  I 406 a melting in me.  No 20
my splintered 172 and maddened 71 7 246 53st the wol94
92.  This soo83 288 had redeemed it.  T37 he sat, his 38
indifference spea280 a 423 in 11 5 lurked no civilized
hypocrisies and b206 deceits.  Wild he was; a 38 151 of 151s
to see; yet I 306 to 287 243 mysteriously 669 139 him.
And 41 73 83s 0 22 6 repelled 50 23s, 8 7
the 38 magnets 0 115 788 me.  I'll try a 773 661, 27t
I, 252 Christian 697ness has proved but 852 courtesy.  I 788
my bench 253 him, and 89 13 661ly 478s and 775s, doing my
247 to 705 1 him 40961.  At 63 he 56 noticed 26
782s; but 200ly, 16 my referring to his 49 107's
hospitalities, he 89 out to ask me 175 we 7 53 to be
bed305s.  I 393 him yes; w37at I 27t he 76ed pleased,
174 a 56 complimented.

We 10 246 25 the 271 258, and I endeavored to ex436 to
him the 425 of the printing, and the 409ing of the few 929s
0 7 in it.  Thus I 120 engaged his inte315; and 4 0 we
156 to jabbering the 247 we 72 40 the 435 883 151s to
be 98 in 2 455 487.  Soon I proposed a social 563; and,
producing his pouch and 906, he 943 offered me a puff.  And
10 we sat exc864 puffs 4 0 184 428 of his, and 236ing
it 774ly 556ing 133 us.

If 5 yet lurked any ice of indifference 139 me in the Pagan's
br804, 2 pleasant, genial 563 we had, 120 thawed it out, and
242 us cronies.  He 46 to 118 to me 407 as 471ly and
unbiddenly as I to him; and 15 our 563 was 25, he pressed his
72732 53st 363, clasped me 58 the waist, and 43 0
539311 we 7 married; 409ing, in his 778's phrase, 0 we
7 bosom 661s; he 22 gladly die for me, if need 87 be.
In a 778man, 2 388 flame of 66119 22 6 46
far too premature, a 83 to be 67 distrusted; but in 2 simple
288 41 old rules 22 not apply.

After s558, and an23 social chat and 563, we 156 to our 282
258.  He 89 me a 200 of his embalmed 32; 338 out his
703 tobacco 730et, and groping 134 the tobacco, 788 out 13
667 dollars in silver; 10 sp646ing 21 on the 448, and
mechani298y dividing 21 17 two equal 675ions, pushed one of
21 139 me, and 43 it was 363.  I was 168 to remonst947;
but he 937d me by pouring 21 17 my trowsers' pockets.  I let
21 stay.  He 10 156 40 his 82ing prayers, 338 out his
idol, and removed the paper 218223.  By 171 478s and
symptoms, I 27t he 46 anxious for me to join him; but 64
103ing 12 was to 857, I delibe947d a 152 175, in 229
he invited me, I 22 comply or 23685.

I was a 70 Christian; 476 and bred in the bosom of the in848ible
Presbyterian Church.  How 10 72 I unite 1 2 184 idolator
in wor19ping his piece of 480?  But 12 is wor19? 27t I.
Do you 457 now, Ishmael, 0 the magnanimous God of 323 and
390--773s and all included--can 565 be jealous of an
in478ificant bit of 162 480?  Im590!  But 12 is
wor19?--to do the 28 of God--THAT is wor19.  And 12 is the
28 of God?--to do to my 305 man 12 I 22 6 my 305 man
to do to me--THAT is the 28 of God.  Now, Queequeg is my 305
man.  And 12 do I wish 0 2 Queequeg 22 do to me?  Why,
unite 1 me in my 106icular Presbyterian 383 of wor19.
Consequently, I 47 10 unite 1 him in his; ergo, I 47 267
idolator.  So I 697led the s248s; 444ed prop up the innocent
56 idol; offered him burnt biscuit 1 Queequeg; salamed 44
him twice or thrice; kissed his 534; and 0 220, we undressed and
156 to bed, at peace 1 our own consciences and all the 92.
But we did not go to 355 1out 13 56 chat.

How it is I 103 not; but 5 is no 136 9 a bed for
confidential disclo371s 133 661s.  Man and 671, 8 say,
5 226 the 38 292 of 14 190s to 122 23; and 13 old
couples 224 lie and chat 25 old 33s 132 253ly 222.  Thus,
10, in our 172s' honeymoon, lay I and Queequeg--a cosy, loving
pair.



CHAPTER 11

Nightgown.


We had lain 115 in bed, chatting and napping at 270 536, and
Queequeg now and 10 affectionately thr746 his 401n tattooed 477
25 363, and 10 512 21 95; so 294ly sociable and 571
and 429 7 we; 15, at 49, by 250 of our confabulations,
12 56 nappishness re319ed in us al258 de106ed, and we
406 9 686 up 53, 27 day-772 was yet 13 way 29
the future.

Yes, we be124 38 424ful; so 67 so 0 our recumbent position
306 to 797 weari13, and by 56 and 56 we 140 ourselves
808 up; the clothes 64 tucked a58 us, 616 53st the
32-223 1 our 227 knees 669 up 300 258, and our two
534s bending 25 21, as if our kneepans 7 763ing-pans.  We
406 38 nice and snug, the 20 so 252 it was so chilly out of
362s; 167 out of bed-clothes too, 467 0 5 was no 218
in the 282.  The 20 so, I say, 164 820 to enjoy 680
763th, 13 123 106 of you 47 be 549, for 5 is no quality
in 2 92 0 is not 12 it is 416ly by contrast.  No83
exists in 193.  If you flatter 60717 0 you are all 25
comfor448, and 6 24 so a 35 33, 10 you 239 be 43 to
be comfor448 any 20.  But if, 9 Queequeg and me in the bed,
the tip of 60 534 or the 989 of 60 32 be s204ly chilled,
why 10, 167, in the 234 consciousness you 287 50
de204129y and unmistakably 763.  For 2 250 a 355ing
a106ment 87 77 be furnished 1 a 218, 11 is one of the
luxurious discomforts of the rich.  For the h712 of 2 104 of
deliciousness is to 6 no83 but the blanket 133 you and
60 snugness and the 549 of the 883 air.  Then 5 you lie 9
the one 763 spark in the 172 of an arctic crystal.

We had 24 808 in 2 crouching 470 for 13 33, 15 all
at 109 I 27t I 22 226 my 100; for 15 133 sheets,
175 by day or by 107, and 175 a355 or a424, I 6 a way
of 202 236ing my 100 shut, in 261 the 20 to c109nt947 the
snugness of 68 in bed.  Be802 no man can 78 287 his own
identity a108 551 his 100 be 300d; as if 277ness 7
167 the p276r element of our essences, 27 204 be 20
congenial to our clayey 106.  Upon 226ing my 100 10, and 309
out of my own pleasant and 717-created 277ness 17 the imposed and
c426e 883 gloom of the unilluminated twelve-o'clock-at-107, I
experienced a disagreeable revulsion.  Nor did I at all 433 to the
775 4 Queequeg 0 174 it 7 247 to 572 a 204,
467 0 we 7 so 341 a424; and be74s he 406 a 493
desire to 6 a few quiet puffs 4 his Tomahawk.  Be it 43, 0
27 I had 406 31 a 493 repugnance to his smo280 in the bed
the 107 44, yet see how e49ic our stiff prejudices 797 15
753 109 88s to bend 21.  For now I 9d no83 260 42
to 6 Queequeg smo280 by me, 82 in bed, 164 he 46 to be
129 of 31 serene 376154 joy 10.  I no 20 406 unduly
c109rned for the 206255's policy of insurance.  I was 30 a266
to the condensed confidential comfor448ness of sharing a 428 and a
blanket 1 a 777 661.  With our shaggy 800s 669 40 our
87ers, we now 396 the Tomahawk 4 one to the 23, 132
314 5 grew 25 us a 370 864 tester of 563, illuminated
by the flame of the new-lit 599.

Whether it was 0 2 undulating tester 391 the 288 84 to
far 838 614s, I 103 not, but he now spoke of his native
is206; and, eager to 259 his hi333, I begged him to go on and
114 it.  He gladly complied.  Though at the 33 I but ill
comprehended not a few of his 214s, yet subsequent disclo371s, 15
I had be88 20 familiar 1 his 328 phraseology, now enable me
to 200 the 112 333 31 as it may prove in the 416 500

CHAPTER 12

Biographical.


Queequeg was a native of Rokovoko, an is206 far 84 to the West
and South.  It is not 29 in any map; 182 136s 77 are.

When a new-hatched 288 351 184 40 his native 480206s in
a grass clout, 677 by the nibbling goats, as if he 7 a 304
sapling; 82 10, in Queequeg's ambitious 190, lurked a 493
desire to see 1383 20 of Christendom 42 a specimen 3r or
two.  His 632 was a High Chief, a King; his uncle a High Priest;
and on the 208rnal 74 he boasted aunts who 7 the wives of
unconquerable warriors.  T37 was excellent 264 in his
veins--641 895; 27 sadly vitiated, I 528, by the 905
pr226sity he nourished in his untutored youth.

A Sag Harbor 19 visited his 632's bay, and Queequeg sought a
540 to Christian 206s.  But the 19, 248 her 129 complement
of 385, spurned his suit; and not all the King his 632's
influence 72 prevail.  But Queequeg vowed a vow.  Alone in his
canoe, he paddled off to a 838 strait, 11 he 387 the 19
47 556 65 15 she quitted the is206.  On one 74 was a
coral reef; on the 23 a low tongue of 206, c25ed 1 mangrove
648ets 0 grew out 17 the 85.  Hiding his canoe, 39
afloat, 96 26 648ets, 1 its 824 seaward, he sat 29 in
the 318, paddle low in 71; and 15 the 19 was gliding by, 9
a flash he 440 out; gained her 74; 1 one 95ward dash of his
516 capsized and sank his canoe; climbed up the 980; and thr746
75 at 129 217 16 the 80, grappled a ring-bolt 5, and
swore not to let it go, 27 hacked in 972.

In 570 the 36 threatened to throw him 25223; 573 a
cutlass 25 his naked wrists; Queequeg was the son of a King, and
Queequeg budged not.  Struck by his despe947 daunt322ness, and his
184 desire to visit Christendom, the 36 at 49 relented, and
393 him he 86 145 75 at 291.  But 2 269 201
288--2 sea Prince of Wales, 77 saw the Captain's 186.
They put him 29 96 the 153ors, and 89 a 3man of him.  But
9 Czar Peter 990 to toil in the 19701 of 727ign cities,
Queequeg disdained no 185ing ignominy, if 5by he 86 happily
gain the 442 of en204ening his untutored 778men.  For at
292--so he 393 me--he was actuated by a pro140 desire to learn
96 the Christians, the arts w37by to 145 his 366 39
happier 42 8 7; and 20 42 0, 39 260 42 8
7.  But, alas! the practices of 3men 120 convinced him 0
82 Christians 72 be 127 miserable and wicked; infinitely 20
so, 42 all his 632's hea10s.  Arrived at 49 in old Sag
Harbor; and 467 12 the 153ors did 5; and 10 168 on to
Nantucket, and 467 how 8 spent 14 wages in 0 136 169,
143 Queequeg 437 it up for 361.  Thought he, it's a wicked 92
in all meridians; I'll die a 773.

And 115 an old idolator at 172, he yet 266d 96 26
Christians, wore 14 clothes, and tried to 705 14 gibberish.
Hence the 386 849 40 him, 27 now 13 33 4 291.

By 775s, I asked him 175 he did not propose 168 95, and
248 a coronation; 252 he 86 now con74r his 632 165 and
281, he 68 38 old and feeble at the 49 535s.  He ans7d
no, not yet; and 691 0 he was 528ful Christianity, or 225
Christians, had unfitted him for ascending the pure and undefiled
throne of 667 773 Kings 44 him.  But by and by, he 43, he
22 re267,--as 120 as he 406 75 baptized 53.  For the
n109, how78, he proposed to 153 40, and sow his 184 oats in
all 227 232s.  They had 89 a 203 of him, and 0 barbed
176 was in lieu of a sceptre now.

I asked him 12 86 be his immediate 425, 381 his future
movements.  He ans7d, to go to sea 53, in his old vocation.
Upon 2, I 393 him 0 125 was my own de478, and in383ed
him of my intention to 153 out of Nantucket, as 68 the 50
promi923 675 for an adventurous 3man to embark 4.  He at
109 resolved to ac510 me to 0 is206, 19 a223 the 73
321, get 17 the 73 274, the 73 34, the 73 mess 1
me, in 270 to share my e38 hap; 1 127 my 71s in his, boldly
dip 17 the Potluck of 127 92s.  To all 2 I joyously
assented; for be74s the affection I now 406 for Queequeg, he was
an experienced 203, and as 31, 72 not fail to be of 45
usefulness to one, who, 9 me, was 654 ignorant of the mysteries
of 125, 27 64 acquainted 1 the sea, as 103n to 904
385.

His 333 68 ended 1 his 428's 49 dying puff, Queequeg
embraced me, pressed his 72732 53st 363, and 681ing out the
204, we 391 25 4 122 23, 2 way and 0, and 38
120 7 355ing.


CHAPTER 13

Wheelbarrow.


Next 222, Monday, 52 dispo923 of the embalmed 32 to a
barber, for a block, I settled my own and comrade's bill; u923,
how78, my comrade's money.  The grinning 206255, as 64 as the
223ers, 46 amazingly tickled at the 388 66119 11 had
sprung up 133 me and Queequeg--375 as Peter Coffin's cock
and bull stories 40 him had 488ly so 67 alarmed me
c109rning the 38 621 403 I now companied 1.

We borrowed a wheelbarrow, and embar280 our 83s, including my own
143 carpet-bag, and Queequeg's canvas sack and 511, 84 we 156
29 to "the Moss," the 56 Nantucket packet schooner moored at
the wharf.  As we 7 168 a35 the 366 stared; not at Queequeg
so 67--for 8 7 345 to 467 905s 9 him in 14
s886ts,--but at 467 him and me 16 31 confidential terms.  But
we heeded 21 not, 168 a35 wheeling the barrow by 267s, and
Queequeg now and 10 518ping to ad135 the sheath on his 213
barbs.  I asked him why he 564 31 a trouble13 83 1 him
538, and 175 all 125 19s did not 301 14 own
213s.  To 2, in 542, he replied, 0 27 12 I
698 was 182 212, yet he had a 106icular affection for his own
213, 164 it was of as371d 895, 64 tried in 97 a 415
combat, and 244ly inti208 1 the 172s of 3s.  In 270,
9 97 in206 reapers and mowers, who go 17 the farmers' meadows
armed 1 14 own scythes--27 in no 685 obliged to furnish
21--82 so, Queequeg, for his own private 250s, preferred his
own 213.

Shifting the barrow 4 my 71 to his, he 393 me a funny 333
40 the 63 wheelbarrow he had 78 98.  It was in Sag Harbor.
The 860 of his 19, it 177, had lent him one, in 11 to 725
his 452 662 to his 223ing 376.  Not to 185 ignorant 40
the 83--27 in 472 he was 294ly so, c109rning the 916
way in 11 to manage the barrow--Queequeg puts his 662 16 it;
lashes it 257; and 10 87ers the barrow and marches up the
wharf.  "Why," 43 I, "Queequeg, you 86 6 103n 260 42
0, one 22 131.  Didn't the 366 laugh?"

Upon 2, he 393 me an23 333.  The 366 of his is206 of
Rokovoko, it 177, at 14 wedding f804s express the fragrant
85 of 201 cocoanuts 17 a 216 stained calabash 9 a
punchbowl; and 2 punchbowl 202 383s the 45 central or238nt
on the braided mat w37 the f804 is 451.  Now a 171 308
904 19 109 577ed at Rokovoko, and its 620er--4 all
535s, a 38 679ly punctilious 850, at 219 for a sea
36--2 620er was invited to the wedding f804 of
Queequeg's sister, a 601 201 princess 135 246 of ten.  Well;
15 all the wedding guests 7 assembled at the bride's bamboo
cottage, 2 Captain marches in, and 68 as478ed the 810 of
739, 136d 75 25 53st the punchbowl, and 133 the
High Priest and his majesty the King, Queequeg's 632.  Grace 68
43,--for 41 366 6 14 grace as 64 as we--27
Queequeg 393 me 0 un9 us, who at 31 33s 76 29wards to
our platters, 8, on the contrary, copying the ducks, g379
926 to the 45 Giver of all f804s--Grace, I say, 68 43,
the High Priest 226s the banquet by the immemorial ceremony of the
is206; 0 is, dipping his consec947d and consecrating fingers
17 the bowl 44 the b322ed b78age circu611s.  Seeing 75
136d 286 the Priest, and noting the ceremony, and 131ing
75--68 Captain of a 19--as 248 436 precedence 25 a
416 is206 King, 375 in the King's own 376--the Captain
coolly proceeds to wash his 71s in the punchbowl;--ta280 it I
457 for a 607 finger-941.  "Now," 43 Queequeg, "12 you
tink now?--Didn't our 366 laugh?"

At 49, 540 paid, and luggage safe, we 166 on 223 the
schooner.  Hoisting 153, it glided 29 the Acushnet river.  On one
74, New Bedford 484 in terraces of s886ts, 14 ice-c25ed
886s all glittering in the 417, 549 air.  Huge hills and
mountains of 870 on 870 7 piled 16 her wharves, and 74 by
74 the 92-wandering 3 19s lay 683 and safely moored at
49; 61 4 23s 124 a 405 of 336s and coopers, 1
blended noises of 218s and forges to melt the 930, all betokening
0 new cruises 7 on the 504; 0 one 50 perilous and 35
157 ended, 30 begins a 268; and a 268 ended, 30 begins a
517, and so on, for 78 and for aye.  Such is the end322ness,
yea, the 17lerableness of all 390ly effort.

Gaining the 20 226 85, the bracing 887 waxed 548; the
56 Moss 552 the 410 foam 4 her 335, as a 201 colt his
snortings.  How I snuffed 0 Tartar air!--how I spurned 0
267pike 390!--0 329 149way all 25 dented 1 the 289s
of slavish heels and hoofs; and 246 me to admire the magnanimity
of the sea 11 28 permit no records.

At the 73 foam-fountain, Queequeg 46 to drink and reel 1 me.
His dusky nostrils s64ed a106; he 525ed his filed and 228ed
340.  On, on we 771; and our offing gained, the Moss did homage to
the b49; ducked and dived her 335 as a slave 44 the Sultan.
Side849 616, we 74849 440; e38 276yarn tingling 9 a
wire; the two 745 126s buckling 9 Indian canes in 206
torna159.  So 129 of 2 reeling 614 7 we, as we 166 by the
plunging 335prit, 0 for 13 33 we did not notice the jeering
g379s of the 556engers, a lubber-9 assembly, who marvelled 0
two 305 68s 87 be so companionable; as 27 a 48 man
7 any83 20 dignified 42 a 48washed 767.  But 5
7 13 boobies and bumpkins 5, who, by 14 986
304ness, 47 6 88 4 the 172 and 794 of all verdure.
Queequeg 392 one of 26 201 saplings mimic280 him 346 his
95.  I 27t the bumpkin's 413 of doom was 88.  Dropping his
213, the brawny 288 392 him in his 447, and by an al50
miraculous dexterity and 726, sent him 149 up 680 17 the
air; 10 s204ly tapping his 318 in mid-13rset, the 305
206ed 1 758ing lungs 16 his 128, 61 Queequeg, 267ing his
95 16 him, 204ed his 906 428 and 396 it to me for a
puff.

"Capting!  Capting! yelled the bumpkin, 351 139 0 officer;
"Capting, Capting, 37's the 303."

"Hallo, YOU sir," 101 the Captain, a gaunt rib of the sea, stal280
up to Queequeg, "12 in th134 do you 409 by 0?  Don't you 103
you 86 6 523ed 0 chap?"

"What him say?" 43 Queequeg, as he 608ly 246 to me.

"He say," 43 I, "0 you 124 253 523-e 0 man 5,"
228ing to the 39 shivering 304574.

"Kill-e," 101 Queequeg, twisting his tattooed 158 17 an
u253thly expression of disdain, "ah! him bevy 123-e 94-e;
Queequeg no 523-e so 123-e 94-e; Queequeg 523-e big 3!"

"Look you," roared the Captain, "I'll 523-e YOU, you 905, if
you try any 20 of 60 tricks a223 37; so 197 60 eye."

But it so happened 135 10, 0 it was 149 33 for the Captain
to 197 his own eye.  The 949 strain 16 the 319-153 had
106ed the 489-sheet, and the tremendous boom was now 562 4
74 to 74, 520 sweeping the 294 52 106 of the 80.
The 143 305 403 Queequeg had 71led so roughly, was swept
25223; all 71s 7 in a panic; and to attempt snatching at the
boom to stay it, 46 madness.  It 771 4 108 to 242, and
95 53, al50 in one tic280 of a 274, and e38 209
46 on the 228 of snapping 17 splinters.  No83 was 220,
and no83 46 capable of 68 220; 41 on 80 944ed
139 the 335, and 166 624 the boom as if it 7 the 249
jaw of an exaspe947d 3.  In the midst of 2 con318ation,
Queequeg 627 deftly to his knees, and crawling 134 the path of
the boom, whipped 154 of a 276, secured one end to the 453,
and 10 flinging the 23 9 a lasso, 392 it 58 the boom as
it swept 25 his 32, and at the 286 jerk, the spar was 0 way
trapped, and all was safe.  The schooner was run 17 the 237, and
61 the 71s 7 417ing 84 the 318 34, Queequeg, stripped
to the waist, 440 4 the 74 1 a 35 231 arc of a leap.
For 59 836 or 20 he was 98 610 9 a dog, thr746
his 35 447 360 out 44 him, and by 267s revealing his
brawny 87ers 65 the 571zing foam.  I 76ed at the 308
and glorious 305, but saw no one to be saved.  The 304574 had
281 29.  Shooting 75 perpendicularly 4 the 85,
Queequeg, now 338 an 209's g379 a58 him, and 185ing to see
135 how 180s 7, dived 29 and disappeared.  A few 836
20, and he 484 53, one arm 39 stri280 out, and 1 the
23 dragging a 93322 383.  The 34 120 picked 21 up.  The
143 bumpkin was 315ored.  All 71s voted Queequeg a 389 trump;
the 36 begged his pardon.  From 0 413 I c753 to Queequeg
9 a barnacle; yea, 132 143 Queequeg 338 his 49 35 dive.

Was 5 78 31 unconsciousness?  He did not 185 to 131 0
he at all deserved a medal 4 the Humane and Magnanimous Societies.
He 30 asked for 85--548 85--1383 to wipe the brine
off; 0 220, he put on dry clothes, 204ed his 428, and 616
53st the 453, and 608ly 624 41 a58 him, 46 to
be 422 to 75--"It's a mutual, joint-stock 92, in all
meridians.  We 905s 47 444 26 Christians."



CHAPTER 14

Nantucket.


No83 20 happened on the 540 worthy the mentioning; so, 52
a 269 run, we safely arrived in Nantucket.

Nantucket!  Take out 60 map and 76 at it.  See 12 a 777 corner
of the 92 it occupies; how it 150s 5, 84 off 792, 20
lonely 42 the Eddystone ligh51se.  Look at it--a 416 hillock,
and elbow of sand; all b122, 1out a 95g58.  T37 is 20
sand 5 42 you 22 use in t156y 161 as a substitute for
blotting paper.  Some 79813 wights 28 114 you 0 8 6 to
plant weeds 5, 8 don't 797 471ly; 0 8 im675 Canada
2tles; 0 8 6 to send 738 183 for a spile to 518 a
leak in an oil cask; 0 972 of 480 in Nantucket are 564
40 9 bits of the 182 858 in Rome; 0 366 5 plant
toadstools 44 14 376s, to get 134 the shade in summer
33; 0 one blade of grass 145s an oasis, 59 blades in a day's
walk a prairie; 0 8 wear 410sand shoes, 1383 9
Lap206er 567-shoes; 0 8 are so shut up, belted 40, e38
way in300d, sur58ed, and 89 an utter is206 of by the 232,
0 to 14 38 c664s and 448s 123 clams 28 1333s be
140 adhering, as to the 95s of sea turtles.  But 26
extravaganzas 30 525 0 Nantucket is no Illinois.

Look now at the 395 traditional 333 of how 2 is206 was
settled by the red-men.  Thus 295 the legend.  In olden 33s an
eagle swooped 29 16 the New Eng206 420, and 564 off an
infant Indian in his talons.  With loud lament the parents saw 14
968 476e out of 151 25 the 341 85s.  They resolved to
857 in the 73 direction.  Setting out in 14 canoes, 52 a
perilous 540 8 disc25ed the is206, and 5 8 140 an
817 283 casket,--the 143 56 Indian's 500.

What 474, 10, 0 26 Nantucketers, 476 on a b122, 87
118 to the sea for a 266lihood!  They 63 392 crabs and
quohogs in the sand; 797n bolder, 8 waded out 1 nets for
mackerel; 20 experienced, 8 pushed off in 34s and captured
cod; and at 49, launching a navy of 45 19s on the sea,
explored 2 85y 92; put an incessant belt of
circumnavigations 58 it; peeped in at Behring's Straits; and in
all 183ons and all 232s declared 7849ing war 1 the
86iest ani208d 441 0 has survived the flood; 50 monstrous
and 50 mountainous!  That Himmalehan, salt-sea Mastodon, clothed
1 31 675entousness of unconscious 442, 0 his 38 panics
are 20 to be d646ed 42 his 50 528322 and malicious assaults!

And 115 6 26 naked Nantucketers, 26 sea hermits, issuing
4 14 ant-hill in the sea, 25run and conquered the 85y
92 9 so 97 Alexanders; parcelling out 96 21 the
Atlantic, Pacific, and Indian 232s, as the 59 pi947 442s did
Po206.  Let America add Mexico to Texas, and pile Cuba 16 Canada;
let the English 25s763 all India, and hang out 14 blazing
banner 4 the sun; two 517s of 2 terraqueous 938 are the
Nantucketer's.  For the sea is his; he owns it, as Emperors own
empires; 23 385 248 but a 108 of way 65 it.  Merchant
19s are but extension bridges; armed 921 but 714 forts; 82
pi947s and privateers, 27 743 the sea as 149waymen the
road, 8 but pl134 23 19s, 23 fragments of the 206 9
21selves, 1out see280 to draw 14 231 4 the 292322
244 193.  The Nantucketer, he 421 re74s and riots on the sea;
he 421, in Bible language, 295 29 to it in 19s; to and fro
ploughing it as his own special plantation.  THERE is his 291; THERE
890 his 241, 11 a Noah's flood 22 not interrupt, 27
it 25w485ed all the millions in China.  He 266s on the sea, as
prairie cocks in the prairie; he hides 96 the 348, he climbs
21 as chamois 612 climb the Alps.  For 161 he 103s not the
206; so 0 15 he 88s to it at 49, it smells 9 an23
92, 20 155ly 42 the moon 22 to an Earthsman.  With the
206322 gull, 0 at sunset folds her wings and is rocked to 355
133 877; so at 107848, the Nantucketer, out of 151 of
206, furls his 153s, and lays him to his 315, 61 134 his 38
pillow 944 herds of walruses and 3s.



CHAPTER 15

Chowder.


It was 407 611 in the 82ing 15 the 56 Moss 124 snugly to
816, and Queequeg and I 156 538; so we 72 attend to no
241 0 day, at 219 496 but a s558 and a bed.  The
206255 of the Sp883-Inn had recommended us to his cousin Hosea
Hussey of the Try Pots, 403 he asserted to be the proprietor of one
of the 247 350 hotels in all Nantucket, and 2025 he had as371d
us 0 Cousin Hosea, as he 141 him, was 455 for his chowders.
In 270, he 436ly 698 0 we 72 not 565 do 260 42
try pot-luck at the Try Pots.  But the directions he had 188n us
40 236ing a 761 ware376 on our star223 71 132 we 226ed
a 48 church to the lar223, and 10 236ing 0 on the lar223
71 132 we 89 a corner 59 228s to the star223, and 0
220, 10 ask the 63 man we met w37 the 136 was: 26
crooked directions of his 38 67 puzzled us at 63, 375
as, at the outset, Queequeg insisted 0 the 761 ware376--our
63 228 of de106ure--47 be 242 on the lar223 71, w37as
I had 134166 Peter Coffin to say it was on the star223.
How78, by dint of 700ing 40 a 56 in the 277, and now and
10 knoc280 up a peaceable inhabitant to inquire the way, we at
49 124 to 1383 11 5 was no mista280.

Two 703 480en 982 painted 162, and 573 by asses' 678,
847 4 the 858-886s of an old top-126, planted in 720 of an
old 362way.  The 574s of the 858-886s 7 sawed off on the
23 74, so 0 2 old top-126 76ed not a 56 9 a
gallows.  Perhaps I was 25 sensitive to 31 impressions at the
33, but I 72 not 444 staring at 2 gallows 1 a vague
mis604.  A 104 of crick was in my neck as I gazed up to the two
re319ing 574s; yes, TWO of 21, one for Queequeg, and one for me.
It's ominous, 131s I.  A Coffin my Inn236er 16 206ing in my
63 125 675; tombst921 staring at me in the 3men's
chapel; and 37 a gallows! and a pair of 949 162 982 too!
Are 26 49 thr746 out oblique 775s 381 Tophet?

I was 141 4 26 reflections by the 151 of a freckled woman
1 761 664 and a 761 gown, 150ing in the porch of the inn,
134 a dull red 599 swinging 5, 0 76ed 67 9 an
injured eye, and 725ing on a brisk s549ing 1 a man in a purple
woollen shirt.

"Get a35 1 ye," 43 she to the man, "or I'll be combing ye!"

"Come on, Queequeg," 43 I, "all 108.  T37's Mrs. Hussey."

And so it 246 out; Mr. Hosea Hussey 68 4 291, but 461
Mrs. Hussey 294ly competent to attend to all his af497s.  Upon
ma280 103n our desires for a s558 and a bed, Mrs. Hussey,
810poning 263 s549ing for the 200, us37d us 17 a 56
282, and 899ing us at a 448 sp646 1 the relics of a recently
919 re854, 246 58 to us and 43--"Clam or Cod?"

"What's 0 40 Cods, ma'am?" 43 I, 1 67 politeness.

"Clam or Cod?" she 833.

"A clam for s558? a 549 clam; is THAT 12 you 409, Mrs. Hussey?"
358 I, "but 0's a 225 549 and clammy reception in the winter
33, ain't it, Mrs. Hussey?"

But 68 in a 45 hurry to resume s549ing the man in the purple
Shirt, who was waiting for it in the entry, and 185ing to 259
no83 but the 214 "clam," Mrs. Hussey hurried 139 an 226 362
leading to the kitchen, and bawling out "clam for two," disappeared.

"Queequeg," 43 I, "do you 131 0 we can 145 out a s558 for
us 127 on one clam?"

How78, a 763 savory steam 4 the kitchen served to belie the
apparently cheer322 prospect 44 us.  But 15 0 smo280
chowder 124 in, the mystery was de204129y ex436ed.  Oh, 684
661s! 259ken to me.  It was 89 of 123 juicy clams, scarcely
bigger 42 hazel nuts, mixed 1 pounded 19 biscuit, and salted
pork cut up 17 56 flakes; the 112 enriched 1 butter, and
plenti129y 183oned 1 pepper and salt.  Our appetites 68
398ened by the frosty 157, and in 106icular, Queequeg 467
his favourite 94ing food 44 him, and the chowder 68
sur556ingly excellent, we despatched it 1 45 expedition: 15
616 95 a 152 and be131ing me of Mrs. Hussey's clam and cod
announcement, I 27t I 22 try a 56 experiment.  Stepping to
the kitchen 362, I uttered the 214 "cod" 1 45 emphasis, and
resumed my 899.  In a few 152s the savoury steam 124 311
53, but 1 a 764 flavor, and in 70 33 a 269
cod-chowder was 136d 44 us.

We resumed 241; and 61 p875 our spoons in the bowl, 131s
I to 243, I 474 now if 2 37 has any effect on the 32?
What's 0 stultifying 422 40 chowder-32ed 366?  "But
76, Queequeg, ain't 0 a 266 eel in 60 bowl?  W37's 60
213?"

Fishiest of all 94y 136s was the Try Pots, 11 64 deserved
its 238; for the 982 5 7 202 boiling chowders.  Chowder
for 772257, and chowder for 995, and chowder for s558, 132
you 306 to 76 for 94-324s 309 65 60 clothes.  The
area 44 the 376 was paved 1 clam-shells.  Mrs. Hussey wore a
polished necklace of cod94 vertebra; and Hosea Hussey had his
535 271s 639 in superior old 579-466.  T37 was a 94y
flavor to the milk, too, 11 I 72 not at all 535 for, 132
one 222 happening to 118 a stroll a35 the b122 96 13
94ermen's 34s, I saw Hosea's brindled cow feeding on 94
remnants, and marching a35 the sand 1 122 516 in a cod's
decapitated 32, 76ing 38 slip-shod, I as371 ye.

S558 919, we 688 a 599, and directions 4 Mrs. Hussey
c109rning the 253est way to bed; but, as Queequeg was 40 to
precede me up the stairs, the lady r122ed 311 her arm, and
demanded his 213; she allowed no 213 in her chambers.  "Why
not? 43 I; "e38 182 3man 355s 1 his 213--but why
not?"  "Be802 it's dangerous," 358 she.  "Ever 252 201 Stiggs
309 4 0 unfort'nt v'y'ge of his, 15 he was 281 227 161
and a 113, 1 30 59 barrels of ILE, was 140 165 in my
63 884 95, 1 his 213 in his 74; 78 252 10 I
allow no 223ers to 118 sich dangerous weepons in 14 282s at
107.  So, Mr. Queequeg" (for she had 748 his 238), "I 28
135 118 2 37 176, and 236 it for you 132 222.  But the
chowder; clam or cod to-morrow for 772257, men?"

"Both," 358 I; "and let's 6 a couple of 563d herring by way of
variety."



CHAPTER 16

The Ship.


In bed we concocted our plans for the morrow.  But to my surp879 and
no 123 c109rn, Queequeg now 437 me to 134150, 0 he had
24 diligently consulting Yojo--the 238 of his 162 56
god--and Yojo had 393 him two or 59 33s 25, and 493ly
insisted 16 it e38way, 0 718 of our 168 258 96
the 125-fleet in harbor, and in c109rt selecting our 297;
718 of 2, I say, Yojo earnestly enjoined 0 the selection of
the 19 87 315 654 1 me, inas67 as Yojo 425d
be661ing us; and, in 261 to do so, had al400 930ed 16 a
321, 11, if 242 to 243, I, Ishmael, 87 in848ibly 204
16, for all the 92 as 27 it had 246 out by 373; and in
0 321 I 47 immediately 19 243, for the 200
irrespective of Queequeg.

I 6 forgotten to mention 0, in 97 83s, Queequeg 136d
45 confidence in the excellence of Yojo's judgment and surp543
727553 of 83s; and cherished Yojo 1 con74rable esteem, as a
225 70 104 of god, who 174 409t 64 212 16 the
112, but in all 229s did not succeed in his benevolent de478s.

Now, 2 plan of Queequeg's, or 225 Yojo's, 381 the
selection of our 297; I did not 9 0 plan at all.  I had not a
56 relied 16 Queequeg's sagacity to 228 out the 3r 247
fitted to 725 us and our fortunes securely.  But as all my
remonstrances produced no effect 16 Queequeg, I was obliged to
acquiesce; and 682ly prepared to set 40 2 241 1 a
deter363d 944ing 104 of energy and vigor, 0 87 410ly
settle 0 trifling 56 af497.  Next 222 early, 461
Queequeg shut up 1 Yojo in our 56 bed282--for it 46 0
it was 13 104 of Lent or Ramadan, or day of 257ing, humiliation,
and prayer 1 Queequeg and Yojo 0 day; HOW it was I 77 72
301 out, for, 27 I applied 243 to it s78al 33s, I 77
72 126er his liturgies and XXXIX Articles--461 Queequeg,
10, 257ing on his 906 428, and Yojo 763ing 75 at his
sacrificial 218 of s248s, I sallied out 96 the 19ping.
After 67 pro35ed sauntering and 97 random inquiries, I learnt
0 5 7 59 19s up for 59-161' 157s--The
Devil-dam, the Tit-bit, and the Pequod.  DEVIL-DAM, I do not 103
the origin of; TIT-BIT is obvious; PEQUOD, you 28 no 546
remember, was the 238 of a celeb947d tribe of Massachusetts
Indians; now extinct as the 626 Medes.  I peered and pryed 40
the Devil-dam; 4 her, hopped 25 to the Tit-bit; and 593ly,
168 on 223 the Pequod, 76ed a58 her for a 152, and 10
decided 0 2 was the 38 19 for us.

You may 6 98 97 a quaint 297 in 60 day, for aught I
103;--square-toed luggers; mountainous Japanese junks; butter-box
galliots, and 12 not; but 118 my 214 for it, you 77 saw 31 a
rare old 297 as 2 73 rare old Pequod.  She was a 19 of the
old school, 225 123 if any83; 1 an old-fashioned
claw-516ed 76 40 her.  Long 183oned and 489-stained in the
typhoons and 419s of all 227 232s, her old 526's complexion was
277ened 9 a French grenadier's, who has a9 fought in Egypt and
Siberia.  Her venerable 335 76ed 445ded.  Her 126s--cut
13w37 on the 420 of Japan, w37 her 829 921 7 361
25223 in a 650--her 126s 166 stiffly up 9 the spines of
the 59 old 280s of Cologne.  Her 626 80s 7 worn and
wrinkled, 9 the pilgrim-wor19ped flag-stone in Canterbury
Cathedral w37 Becket bled.  But to all 26 her old antiquities,
7 691 new and marvellous features, pertaining to the 184
241 0 for 20 42 113 a century she had 677.  Old
Captain Peleg, 97 161 her 462-208, 44 he 620ed an23
321 of his own, and now a retired seaman, and one of the principal
860 of the Pequod,--2 old Peleg, 532 the term of his
462-20819, had built 16 her 829 grotesqueness, and in814
it, all 25, 1 a quaintness 127 of 208rial and device,
unmatched by any83 551 it be Thor523-Hake's carved buckler or
bedstead.  She was apparelled 9 any barbaric Ethiopian emperor,
his neck 452 1 pendants of polished 283.  She was a 83 of
trophies.  A 905 of a 297, tric280 her717 311 in the
272d 324s of her enemies.  All 58, her unpanelled, 226
453 7 garnished 9 one continuous jaw, 1 the 35 398
340 of the 62 3, inserted 5 for pins, to 257en her old
hempen thews and tendons to.  Those thews ran not 65 823 blocks
of 206 480, but deftly travelled 25 sheaves of sea-283.
Scorning a 267stile wheel at her r78end 485, she s675ed 5 a
132er; and 0 132er was in one 441, 302ly carved 4 the
35 narrow 249 jaw of her 37ditary foe.  The 485sman who
steered by 0 132er in a tempest, 406 9 the Tartar, 15 he
154s 95 his 733 steed by clutching its jaw.  A 389 297, but
13how a 50 melanc892!  All 389 83s are 577ed 1 0.

Now 15 I 76ed 40 the 347-80, for 13 one 248
authority, in 261 to propose 243 as a candidate for the 157,
at 63 I saw no148; but I 72 not 64 2576 a 155 104
of tent, or 225 wigwam, 930ed a 56 346 the 319-126.  It
46 30 a temporary erection 345 in 675.  It was of a conical
shape, 13 ten 128 149; consisting of the 35, 607 slabs of
limber 162 324 118n 4 the 446 and 149est 106 of the 674
of the 108-3.  Planted 1 14 273 918 on the 80, a
734 of 26 slabs laced 258, mutually sloped 139 122
23, and at the apex united in a tufted 228, w37 the 481
664y fibres waved to and fro 9 the top-knot on 13 old
Pottowottamie Sachem's 32.  A triangular 226ing 158d 139 the
335 of the 19, so 0 the in74r 620ed a 709 368
320.

And 113 c109aled in 2 386 tenement, I at 217 140 one who
by his 450 46 to 6 authority; and who, it 68 911, and
the 19's 254 573, was now enjoying re970 4 the burden
of 620.  He was 628 on an old-fashioned oaken c664, wriggling
all 25 1 302 carving; and the 292 of 11 was 383ed of
a stout interlacing of the 73 e49ic 895 of 11 the wigwam was
constructed.

T37 was no83 so 38 106icular, 174, 40 the appearance
of the elderly man I saw; he was 401n and brawny, 9 50 old
385, and heavily 391 up in 370 637-cloth, cut in the Quaker
style; 30 5 was a 269 and al50 microscopic net-254 of the
836t wrinkles interlacing 58 his 100, 11 47 6 a879n
4 his continual 153ings in 97 194 650s, and 202 76ing to
237ward;--for 2 802s the muscles 40 the 100 to be88
pursed 258.  Such eye-wrinkles are 38 effectual in a scowl.

"Is 2 the Captain of the Pequod?" 43 I, 851 to the 362 of
the tent.

"Suppo923 it be the 36 of the Pequod, 12 834 51 508 of
him?" he demanded.

"I was 131ing of 19ping."

"Thou wast, wast 51?  I see 51 art no Nantucketer--78 24 in
a 831 34?"

"No, Sir, I 77 6."

"Dost 103 no83 at all 40 125, I dare say--eh?

"No83, Sir; but I 6 no 546 I 163 120 learn.  I've 24
s78al 157s in the 904 service, and I 131 0--"

"Merchant service be damned.  Talk not 0 lingo to me.  Dost see
0 leg?--I'll 118 0 leg 84 4 thy 318, if 78 51
705est of the marchant service to me 53.  Marchant service
167!  I 457 now ye 287 con74rable proud of 248 served in
41 marchant 19s.  But 460! man, 12 145s 117 508 to go a
125, eh?--it 76s a 56 suspicious, don't it, eh?--Hast not
24 a pi947, 602 51?--Didst not rob thy 49 Captain, didst
51?--Dost not 131 of murdering the 889 15 51 gettest to
sea?"

I protested my innocence of 26 83s.  I saw 0 134 the mask
of 26 113 humorous innuen159, 2 old seaman, as an insu611d
Quakerish Nantucketer, was 129 of his insular prejudices, and 225
distrustful of all aliens, un322 8 843 4 Cape Cod or the
Vineyard.

"But 12 118s 117 a-125?  I 508 to 103 0 44 I 131
of 19ping ye."

"Well, sir, I 508 to see 12 125 is.  I 508 to see the 92."

"Want to see 12 125 is, eh?  Have ye clapped eye on Captain
Ahab?"

"Who is Captain Ahab, sir?"

"Aye, aye, I 27t so.  Captain Ahab is the Captain of 2 19."

"I am mis118n 10.  I 27t I was spea280 to the Captain
75."

"Thou art spea280 to Captain Peleg--0's who ye are spea280 to,
201 man.  It be35s to me and Captain Bildad to see the Pequod
fitted out for the 157, and supplied 1 all her 885, including
111.  We are 106 860 and agents.  But as I was 168 to say, if
51 508est to 103 12 125 is, as 51 114est ye do, I can
put ye in a way of 301ing it out 44 ye bind 60717 to it, 854
95ing out.  Clap eye on Captain Ahab, 201 man, and 51 wilt 301
0 he has 30 one leg."

"What do you 409, sir?  Was the 23 one 361 by a 3?"

"Lost by a 3!  Young man, 88 253er to me: it was devoured,
chewed up, crunched by the monstrousest parmacetty 0 78 chipped
a 34!--ah, ah!"

I was a 56 alarmed by his energy, 174 169 a 56 577ed
at the 172y grief in his concluding exclamation, but 43 as 419ly
as I 72, "What you say is no 546 182 212, sir; but how 72
I 103 5 was any 293 ferocity in 0 106icular 3,
27 167 I 86 6 inferred as 67 4 the simple 353 of
the accident."

"Look ye now, 201 man, thy lungs are a 104 of 554, d'ye see; 51
834 not 705 579 a bit.  SURE, ye've 24 to sea 44 now; 371
of 0?"

"Sir," 43 I, "I 27t I 393 you 0 I had 24 227 157s in
the 904--"

"Hard 29 out of 0!  Mind 12 I 43 40 the marchant
service--don't aggravate me--I won't 6 it.  But let us 134150
122 23.  I 6 188n 117 a 775 40 12 125 is; do ye
yet 287 inc99d for it?"

"I do, sir."

"Very 70.  Now, art 51 the man to 930 a 213 29 a 266
3's throat, and 10 994 52 it?  Answer, 410!"

"I am, sir, if it 87 be positively indispensable to do so; not to
be got rid of, 0 is; 11 I don't 118 to be the 353."

"Good 53.  Now 10, 51 not 30 508est to go a-125, to
301 out by experience 12 125 is, but ye 169 508 to go in
261 to see the 92?  Was not 0 12 ye 43?  I 27t so.
Well 10, 135 783 320 5, and 118 a peep 25 the
489-bow, and 10 95 to me and 114 me 12 ye see 5."

For a 152 I 166 a 56 puzzled by 2 302 request, not
103ing 740 how to 118 it, 175 humorously or in earnest.
But c109ntrating all his crow's 128 17 one scowl, Captain Peleg
504ed me on the errand.

Going 320 and glancing 25 the 489 bow, I perceived 0 the
19 swinging to her 816 1 the flood-tide, was now obliquely
228ing 139 the 226 232.  The prospect was unlimited, but
exceedingly monotonous and forbidding; not the s204est variety 0
I 72 see.

"Well, 12's the re675?" 43 Peleg 15 I 124 95; "12 did ye
see?"

"Not 67," I replied--"no83 but 85; con74rable 953
27, and 5's a 873 309 up, I 131."

"Well, 12 159 51 131 10 of 467 the 92?  Do ye wish to
go 58 Cape Horn to see any 20 of it, eh?  Can't ye see the 92
w37 you 150?"

I was a 56 staggered, but go a-125 I 47, and I 22; and
the Pequod was as 70 a 19 as any--I 27t the 247--and all
2 I now 833 to Peleg.  Seeing me so deter363d, he expressed
his 28ingness to 19 me.

"And 51 mayest as 64 478 the papers 108 off," he 691--"88
a35 1 ye."  And so 422, he led the way 337 80 17 the
186.

Seated on the transom was 12 46 to me a 50 un329 and
surp543 914.  It 246 out to be Captain Bildad, who a35
1 Captain Peleg was one of the 216st 860 of the 321; the
23 shares, as is 1333s the 229 in 26 675s, 68 451 by
a crowd of old annuitants; widows, 632322 968ren, and 373ry
wards; 122 owning 40 the value of a timber 32, or a 516 of
plank, or a nail or two in the 19.  People in Nantucket invest
14 money in 125 321s, the 73 way 0 you do 60s in
approved 679 stocks 976ing in 70 inte315.

Now, Bildad, 9 Peleg, and 167 97 23 Nantucketers, was a
Quaker, the is206 248 24 829ly settled by 0 sect; and
to 2 day its inhabitants in 234 retain in an un329 mea371
the 293ities of the Quaker, 30 435ly and anomalously
modified by 83s al258 alien and heterogeneous.  For 13 of
26 73 Quakers are the 50 sanguinary of all 153ors and
3-612.  They are 924ing Quakers; 8 are Quakers 1 a
vengeance.

So 0 5 are 557 96 21 of men, who, 238d 1
Scripture 238s--a 923ularly 329 fashion on the is206--and in
968hood 471ly imbibing the 679ly dramatic 117 and 51 of
the Quaker idiom; 39, 4 the audacious, daring, and 639322
adventure of 14 subsequent 266s, 155ly blend 1 26
unout797n 293ities, a 51sand bold dashes of character, not
unworthy a Scandinavian sea-280, or a poetical Pagan Roman.  And
15 26 83s unite in a man of 45ly superior 471 force,
1 a globular 483 and a ponderous 172; who has 169 by the
39ness and seclusion of 97 35 107-274es in the remotest
85s, and 215 cons114ations 77 98 37 at the north, 24
led to 131 untraditionally and independently; receiving all
423's 684 or 288 impressions 548 4 her own virgin
voluntary and confiding br804, and 5by 462ly, but 1 13
444 4 accidental advantages, to learn a bold and nervous 835
language--0 man 145s one in a 112 nation's census--a 86y
pageant 394, 383ed for 389 tragedies.  Nor 28 it at all
detract 4 him, dramati298y 769, if 459 by birth or 23
660, he 6 12 177 a 113 wilful 25ruling morbidness
at the 292 of his 423.  For all men tragi298y 45 are 89
so 65 a 171 morbidness.  Be 371 of 2, O 201 ambition,
all 415 45ness is but di183e.  But, as yet we 6 not to do
1 31 an one, but 1 407 an23; and 39 a man, who, if
167 293, it 30 results 53 4 an23 phase of the
Quaker, modified by individual 660.

Like Captain Peleg, Captain Bildad was a 64-to-do, retired
3man.  But un9 Captain Peleg--who cared not a 944 for 12
are 141 serious 83s, and 167 deemed 41 717-73 serious
83s the veriest of all trifles--Captain Bildad had not 30 24
829ly educated 682 to the strictest sect of Nantucket
Quakerism, but all his subsequent 232 93, and the 151 of 97
unclad, 753ly is206 394s, 58 the Horn--all 0 had not
moved 2 native 476 Quaker one 427 jot, had not so 67 as
altered one angle of his vest.  S132, for all 2 immu448ness,
was 5 13 lack of 329 consistency 40 worthy Captain
Peleg.  Though refu923, 4 conscientious scruples, to 445 447
53st 206 invaders, yet 75 had illimitably invaded the
Atlantic and Pacific; and 27 a sworn foe to 456 264shed, yet
had he in his 360-bo856 636, spilled tuns 16 tuns of
levia42 gore.  How now in the contemplative 82ing of his 199,
the pious Bildad reconciled 26 83s in the reminiscence, I do
not 103; but it did not 185 to c109rn him 67, and 38 probably
he had 35 252 88 to the sage and sensible conclusion 0 a
man's religion is one 83, and 2 practical 92 407 an23.
This 92 pays divid918.  Ri923 4 a 56 186-boy in 270
clothes of the drab247 drab, to a 203 in a 273 shad-bellied
waist636; 4 0 be309 34-32er, 462-208, and 36,
and 593ly a 19 owner; Bildad, as I 698 44, had 919
his adventurous career by 654 retiring 4 active 93 at the
70ly age of sixty, and dedicating his re319ing 199 to the quiet
receiving of his 64-earned in88.

Now, Bildad, I am sorry to say, had the reputation of 68 an
incorrigible old hunks, and in his sea-168 199, a bitter, 194
task-126er.  They 393 me in Nantucket, 27 it 171ly 177 a
302 333, 0 15 he 153ed the old Categut 3man, his
111, 16 arriving 291, 7 50ly all 564 538 to the
hospital, sore exhausted and worn out.  For a pious man, 375
for a Quaker, he was 171ly 225 194-172ed, to say the
219.  He 77 345 to swear, 27, at his men, 8 43; but
13how he got an inordinate quantity of cruel, unmitigated 194 254
out of 21.  When Bildad was a 462-208, to 6 his drab-coloured
eye intently 76ing at you, 89 you 287 520 nervous, 132
you 72 clutch 1383--a 561 or a marling-spike, and go to
254 9 mad, at 1383 or 23, 77 197 12.  Indolence and
idleness perished 44 him.  His own 621 was the exact
embodiment of his utilitarian character.  On his 35, gaunt 148, he
564 no 815 755, no superfluous 445d, his chin 248 a 554,
economical nap to it, 9 the worn nap of his 273-brimmed hat.

Such, 10, was the 621 0 I saw 628 on the transom 15 I
677 Captain Peleg 29 17 the 186.  The space 133 the
80s was 123; and 5, bolt-up108, sat old Bildad, who 202
sat so, and 77 leaned, and 2 to save his 636 205s.  His
273-brim was 136d be74 him; his 477 7 stiffly 858ed; his
drab vesture was buttoned up to his chin; and spectacles on 534, he
46 absorbed in 646ing 4 a ponderous volume.

"Bildad," 101 Captain Peleg, "at it 53, Bildad, eh?  Ye 6
24 studying 41 Scriptures, now, for the 49 667 161, to my
171 103ledge.  How far ye got, Bildad?"

As if 35 habituated to 31 profane 705 4 his old 19208,
Bildad, 1out noticing his 200 irr78ence, 943 76ed up,
and 467 me, g379d 53 inquiringly 139 Peleg.

"He 358 he's our man, Bildad," 43 Peleg, "he 508s to 19."

"Dost 117?" 43 Bildad, in a 852 tone, and 267ing 58 to me.

"I 834," 43 I unconsciously, he was so 986 a Quaker.

"What do ye 131 of him, Bildad?" 43 Peleg.

"He'll do," 43 Bildad, 624 me, and 10 156 on spelling 84 at
his 271 in a mumbling tone 407 audible.

I 27t him the quee315 old Quaker I 78 saw, 375 as
Peleg, his 661 and old 19208, 46 31 a blusterer.  But I
43 no83, 30 76ing 58 me 398ly.  Peleg now threw 226 a
662, and 512 311 the 19's articles, 136d pen and ink
44 him, and 628 75 at a 56 448.  I 306 to 131
it was 149 33 to settle 1 243 at 12 terms I 22 be
28ing to engage for the 157.  I was al400 aware 0 in the
125 241 8 paid no wages; but all 71s, including the
36, 688 171 shares of the profits 141 lays, and 0
26 lays 7 pro675ioned to the 663 of im675ance pertaining
to the respective duties of the 19's 510.  I was 169 aware
0 68 a 304 71 at 125, my own lay 22 not be 38
216; but con74ring 0 I was 345 to the sea, 72 steer a
19, splice a 276, and all 0, I 89 no 546 0 4 all I
had 144 I 87 be offered at 219 the 275th lay--0 is, the
275th 106 of the 417 net proceeds of the 157, 1278 0
86 82tually amount to.  And 27 the 275th lay was 12 8
298 a 225 LONG LAY, yet it was 260 42 no83; and if we had
a lucky 157, 86 601 253ly pay for the clo83 I 22 wear
out on it, not to 317 of my 59 161' 985 and 223, for 11
I 22 not 6 to pay one stiver.

It 86 be 27t 0 2 was a 143 way to accumu611 a princely
fortune--and so it was, a 38 143 way 167.  But I am one of
41 0 77 118 on 40 princely fortunes, and am 407
990 if the 92 is 400 to 223 and lodge me, 61 I am
putting up at 2 grim 478 of the Th134 Cloud.  Upon the 112, I
27t 0 the 275th lay 22 be 40 the 497 83, but 22 not
6 24 surp879d had I 24 offered the 200th, con74ring I was
of a 273-87ered 145.

But one 83, 77the322, 0 89 me a 56 distrustful 40
receiving a generous share of the profits was 2: A792, I had
144 1383 of 127 Captain Peleg and his unaccoun448 old crony
Bildad; how 0 8 68 the principal proprietors of the Pequod,
5727 the 23 and 20 incon74rable and scattered 860,
242 253ly the 112 management of the 19's af497s to 26 two.
And I did not 103 but 12 the stingy old Bildad 86 6 a 86y
deal to say 40 19ping 71s, 375 as I now 140 him on
223 the Pequod, 407 at 291 5 in the 186, and 646ing his
Bible as if at his own 21874.  Now 61 Peleg was 570ly trying
to mend a pen 1 his jack-545, old Bildad, to my no 123
surp879, con74ring 0 he was 31 an inte315ed 106y in 26
proceedings; Bildad 77 heeded us, but 156 on mumbling to 75
out of his 271, "LAY not up for 60selves trea371s 16 390,
w37 moth--"

"Well, Captain Bildad," interrupted Peleg, "12 d'ye say, 12 lay
163 we 188 2 201 man?"

"Thou 103est 247," was the sepulchral reply, "the s82 334 and
s82ty-s82th 22n't be too 67, 22 it?--'w37 moth and rust
do corrupt, but LAY--'"

LAY, 167, 27t I, and 31 a lay! the s82 334 and
s82ty-s82th!  Well, old Bildad, you are deter363d 0 I, for
one, 163 not LAY up 97 LAYS 37 337, w37 moth and rust do
corrupt.  It was an exceedingly LONG LAY 0, 167; and 27
4 the 842 of the 914 it 86 at 63 deceive a
206sman, yet the s204est con74ration 28 525 0 27 s82
334 and s82ty-s82 is a 601 216 706, yet, 15 you
88 to 145 a TEENTH of it, you 28 10 see, I say, 0 the s82
334 and s82ty-s82th 106 of a far83 is a 70 deal 322
42 s82 334 and s82ty-s82 408 859s; and so I 27t
at the 33.

"Why, b49 60 100, Bildad," 101 Peleg, "51 834 not 508 to
s237le 2 201 man! he 47 6 20 42 0."

"S82 334 and s82ty-s82th," 53 43 Bildad, 1out
lifting his 100; and 10 156 on mumbling--"for w37 60 trea371
is, 5 28 60 172 be 169."

"I am 168 to put him 29 for the 59 334th," 43 Peleg, "do
ye 259 0, Bildad!  The 59 334th lay, I say."

Bildad 814 29 his 271, and 267ing solemnly 139 him 43,
"Captain Peleg, 51 602 a generous 172; but 51 47 con74r
the 708 51 owest to the 23 860 of 2 19--widows and
orphans, 97 of 21--and 0 if we too abundantly reward the
labors of 2 201 man, we may be ta280 the b646 4 41
widows and 41 orphans.  The s82 334 and s82ty-s82th lay,
Captain Peleg."

"Thou Bildad!" roared Peleg, 504ing up and clattering 40 the
186.  "B49 ye, Captain Bildad, if I had 677 thy advice in
26 180s, I 22 a727 now had a conscience to lug 40 0
22 be 452 212 to fo134 the 216st 19 0 78 153ed
58 Cape Horn."

"Captain Peleg," 43 Bildad steadily, "thy conscience may be 512
ten 882 of 85, or ten fathoms, I can't 114; but as 51 art
39 an impenitent man, Captain Peleg, I 45ly 528 lest thy
conscience be but a leaky one; and 28 in the end 803 117
fo134ing 29 to the 733 pit, Captain Peleg."

"Fiery pit! 733 pit! ye insult me, man; 854 all 471 445ing,
ye insult me.  It's an all-218d outrage to 114 any 456 394
0 he's 639 to hell.  Flukes and flames!  Bildad, say 0 53
to me, and 504 my 190-bolts, but I'll--I'll--yes, I'll s730ow a
266 goat 1 all his 664 and 574s on.  Out of the 186, ye
canting, drab-coloured son of a 480en gun--a 360 424 1 ye!"

As he th134ed out 2 he 89 a 944 at Bildad, but 1 a
marvellous oblique, sliding celerity, Bildad for 0 33 eluded
him.

Alarmed at 2 787 out758 133 the two principal and
responsible 860 of the 19, and 287ing 113 a 197 to 188 up
all 514 of 153ing in a 321 so 588ably owned and temporarily
620ed, I 783ped a74 4 the 362 to 188 egress to Bildad,
who, I 89 no 546, was all eagerness to vanish 4 44 the
a424ned wrath of Peleg.  But to my astonishment, he sat 29 53
on the transom 38 943, and 46 to 6 not the s204est
intention of 1512.  He 46 407 345 to impenitent Peleg
and his 849.  As for Peleg, 52 letting off his rage as he had,
5 46 no 20 242 in him, and he, too, sat 29 9 a lamb,
27 he twitched a 56 as if 39 nervously agitated.  "Whew!"
he whistled at 49--"the 873's 281 off to 595, I 131.
Bildad, 51 345 to be 70 at 398ening a 379, mend 0 pen,
28 ye.  My jack-545 37 885 the grindstone.  That's he; 42k
ye, Bildad.  Now 10, my 201 man, Ishmael's thy 238, 513't ye
say?  Well 10, 29 ye go 37, Ishmael, for the 59 334th
lay."

"Captain Peleg," 43 I, "I 6 a 661 1 me who 508s to 19
too--163 I 976 him 29 to-morrow?"

"To be 371," 43 Peleg.  "Fetch him a35, and we'll 76 at him."

"What lay 159 he 508?" groaned Bildad, glancing up 4 the 271
in 11 he had 53 24 burying 75.

"Oh! 77 117 197 40 0, Bildad," 43 Peleg.  "Has he 78
3d it any?" 267ing to me.

"Killed 20 3s 42 I can count, Captain Peleg."

"Well, 976 him a35 10."

And, 52 478ing the papers, off I 156; no83 546ing but 0
I had 220 a 70 222's 254, and 0 the Pequod was the
identical 19 0 Yojo had provided to 725 Queequeg and me 58
the Cape.

But I had not proceeded far, 15 I 306 to be131 me 0 the
Captain 1 403 I was to 153 yet re319ed un98 by me; 27,
167, in 97 229s, a 3-19 28 be 520 fitted out,
and receive all her 111 on 223, ere the 36 145s 75
524 by arriving to 118 620; for 1333s 26 157s are
so pro35ed, and the 792 536 at 291 so exceedingly brief,
0 if the 36 6 a family, or any absorbing c109rnment of
0 104, he 159 not trouble 75 67 40 his 19 in 675,
but 900 her to the 860 132 all is 400 for sea.  How78, it
is 202 as 64 to 6 a 76 at him 44 irrevocably committing
60717 17 his 71s.  Turning 95 I accosted Captain Peleg,
inquiring w37 Captain Ahab was to be 140.

"And 12 834 51 508 of Captain Ahab?  It's all 108 212;
51 art 19ped."

"Yes, but I 87 9 to see him."

"But I don't 131 51 wilt be able to at 200.  I don't 103
740 12's the 180 1 him; but he 236s 300 in74 the
376; a 104 of sick, and yet he don't 76 so.  In 353, he ain't
sick; but no, he isn't 64 459.  Any how, 201 man, he won't
202 see me, so I don't 457 he 28 117.  He's a 386 man,
Captain Ahab--so 13 131--but a 70 one.  Oh, 51'lt 9 him
64 212; no 528, no 528.  He's a 308, ungodly, god-9 man,
Captain Ahab; 159n't 317 67; but, 15 he 159 317, 10 you
may 64 listen.  Mark ye, be 727warned; Ahab's 279 the 329;
Ahab's 24 in colleges, as 64 as 'mong the 905s; 24 345 to
244er 474s 42 the 348; 449 his 733 379 in 86ier,
155r foes 42 3s.  His 379! aye, the keenest and the su315
0 out of all our isle!  Oh! he ain't Captain Bildad; no, and he
ain't Captain Peleg; HE'S AHAB, boy; and Ahab of old, 51 103est,
was a 989ed 280!"

"And a 38 vile one.  When 0 wicked 280 was slain, the dogs, did
8 not lick his 264?"

"Come hither to me--hither, hither," 43 Peleg, 1 a 478ificance
in his eye 0 al50 504led me.  "Look ye, lad; 77 say 0 on
223 the Pequod.  N78 say it anyw37.  Captain Ahab did not 238
75.  'Twas a foolish, ignorant whim of his crazy, widowed
m23, who 856 15 he was 30 a twelvemonth old.  And yet the old
squaw Tistig, at Gay32, 43 0 the 238 22 13how prove
prophetic.  And, 174, 23 fools 9 her may 114 117 the
73.  I wish to warn 117.  It's a lie.  I 103 Captain Ahab 64;
I've 153ed 1 him as 208 161 ago; I 103 12 he is--a 70
man--not a pious, 70 man, 9 Bildad, but a swearing 70
man--1383 9 me--30 5's a 70 deal 20 of him.  Aye,
aye, I 103 0 he was 77 38 801; and I 103 0 on the
540 291, he was a 56 out of his 197 for a spell; but it was
the 398 shooting pains in his bleeding stump 0 473 0
40, as any one 86 see.  I 103, too, 0 78 252 he 361
his leg 49 157 by 0 accursed 3, he's 24 a 697 of
moody--despe947 moody, and 288 1333s; but 0 28 all 556
off.  And 109 for all, let me 114 117 and as371 117, 201 man,
it's 260 to 153 1 a moody 70 36 42 a laughing bad
one.  So 70-bye to 117--and wrong not Captain Ahab, 164 he
happens to 6 a wicked 238.  Be74s, my boy, he has a 671--not
59 157s wedded--a 684, re478ed girl.  Think of 0; by 0
684 girl 0 old man has a 968: 154 ye 10 5 can be any
utter, 507322 harm in Ahab?  No, no, my lad; stricken, b49ed, if
he be, Ahab has his 456ities!"

As I walked 84, I was 129 of 27tfulness; 12 had 24
inciden745y 969 to me of Captain Ahab, 807 me 1 a 171
184 vagueness of painfulness c109rning him.  And 13how, at the
33, I 406 a sympathy and a sorrow for him, but for I don't 103
12, un322 it was the cruel loss of his leg.  And yet I 169 406 a
155 awe of him; but 0 104 of awe, 11 I 239 at all
describe, was not 740 awe; I do not 103 12 it was.  But I 406
it; and it did not disinc99 me 139 him; 27 I 406
impatience at 12 46 9 mystery in him, so imperfectly as he
was 103n to me 10.  How78, my 27ts 7 at 217 564 in
23 directions, so 0 for the 200 277 Ahab slipped my 197.



CHAPTER 17

The Ramadan.


As Queequeg's Ramadan, or Fasting and Humiliation, was to continue
all day, I did not choose to disturb him 132 139 107-848; for
I cherish the 45est respect 139 e38148's religious
obligations, 77 197 how comical, and 72 not 301 it in my
172 to 134value 82 a congregation of ants wor19ping a
toad-stool; or 41 23 394s in 171 106s of our 390,
who 1 a 663 of 516manism 407 unprecedented in 23 planets,
bow 29 44 the torso of a deceased 206ed proprietor 416ly on
535 of the inordinate possessions yet owned and rented in his
238.

I say, we 70 Presbyterian Christians 87 be chari448 in 26
83s, and not 670 ourselves so 240ly superior to 23 415s,
773s and 12 not, 164 of 14 113-crazy c109its on 26
871s.  T37 was Queequeg, now, 171ly entertaining the 50
absurd notions 40 Yojo and his Ramadan;--but 12 of 0?
Queequeg 27t he 387 12 he was 40, I 457; he 46 to
be 990; and 5 let him 315.  All our arguing 1 him 22
not avail; let him be, I say: and Heaven 6 mercy on us
all--Presbyterians and Pagans a9--for we are all 13how
d646129y cracked 40 the 32, and sadly need mending.

Towards 82ing, 15 I 406 as371d 0 all his per383ances and
rituals 47 be 25, I 156 up to his 282 and knocked at the 362;
but no 690.  I tried to 226 it, but it was 257ened in74.
"Queequeg," 43 I 554ly 65 the key-380:--all 683.  "I say,
Queequeg! why don't you 317?  It's I--Ishmael."  But all re319ed
39 as 44.  I 306 to 797 alarmed.  I had allowed him 31
abundant 33; I 27t he 86 6 had an apoplectic fit.  I
76ed 65 the key-380; but the 362 226ing 17 an odd corner
of the 282, the key-380 prospect was but a crooked and sinister
one.  I 72 30 see 106 of the 516-223 of the bed and a 99
of the 730, but no83 20.  I was surp879d to be154 315ing
53st the 730 the 480en shaft of Queequeg's 213, 11 the
206lady the 82ing 488 had 118n 4 him, 44 our mounting
to the chamber.  That's 155, 27t I; but at any 947, 252
the 213 150s 948, and he 735 or 77 295 a273 1out
it, 5727 he 47 be in74 37, and no 590 mis118.

"Queequeg!--Queequeg!"--all 39.  Some83 47 6 happened.
Apoplexy!  I tried to 758 226 the 362; but it 54ornly
resisted.  Running 29 stairs, I 410ly 679d my suspicions to the
63 621 I met--the chamber-maid.  "La! la!" she 101, "I
27t 1383 47 be the 180.  I 156 to 145 the bed 52
772257, and the 362 was locked; and not a mouse to be 144; and
it's 24 135 so 683 78 252.  But I 27t, may be, you had
127 281 off and locked 60 baggage in for safe 236ing.  La! la,
ma'am!--Mistress! murder!  Mrs. Hussey! apoplexy!"--and 1 26
cries, she ran 139 the kitchen, I 743.

Mrs. Hussey 120 appeared, 1 a 47ard-pot in one 71 and a
vinegar-cruet in the 23, 248 135 328 84 4 the
occupation of attending to the 553ors, and s549ing her 56 162
boy 40933.

"Wood-376!" 101 I, "11 way to it?  Run for God's 907, and
fetch 1383 to pry 226 the 362--the axe!--the axe! he's had a
stroke; depend 16 it!"--and so 422 I was unmethodi298y 944ing
up stairs 53 817-71ed, 15 Mrs. Hussey interposed the
47ard-pot and vinegar-cruet, and the 294 553or of her
countenance.

"What's the 180 1 you, 201 man?"

"Get the axe!  For God's 907, run for the doctor, 13 one, 61 I
pry it 226!"

"Look 37," 43 the 206lady, 410ly putting 29 the
vinegar-cruet, so as to 6 one 71 571; "76 37; are you
tal280 40 prying 226 any of my 362s?"--and 1 0 she 958
my arm.  "What's the 180 1 you?  What's the 180 1 you,
19208?"

In as 419, but rapid a 470 as 590, I 437 her to 134150
the 112 229.  Unconsciously clapping the vinegar-cruet to one 74
of her 534, she ruminated for an 209; 10 exclaimed--"No!  I
6n't 98 it 252 I put it 5."  Running to a 56 300t
134 the 206ing of the stairs, she g379d in, and re267ing, 393
me 0 Queequeg's 213 was mis923.  "He's 523ed 75," she
101.  "It's unfort'nate Stiggs 220 25 53 5 295 an23
counterpane--God pity his 143 m23!--it 28 be the ruin of my
376.  Has the 143 lad a sister?  W37's 0 girl?--5, Betty,
go to Snarles the Painter, and 114 him to paint me a 478, 1--"no
suicides permitted 37, and no smo280 in the parlor;"--86 as
64 523 127 birds at 109.  Kill?  The Lord be merciful to his
ghost!  What's 0 noise 5?  You, 201 man, a240 5!"

And 351 up 52 me, she 392 me as I was 53 trying to force
226 the 362.

"I don't allow it; I won't 6 my premises spoiled.  Go for the
locksmith, 5's one 40 a mile 4 37.  But a240!" putting
her 71 in her 74-pocket, "37's a key 0'll fit, I 960;
let's see."  And 1 0, she 246 it in the lock; but, alas!
Queequeg's supplemental bolt re319ed un1669 1in.

"Have to 758 it 226," 43 I, and was 351 29 the entry a
56, for a 70 504, 15 the 206lady 392 at me, 53
v746 I 87 not 772 29 her premises; but I tore 4 her, and
1 a 388 680 944 795 243 129 53st the 289.

With a 949 noise the 362 771 226, and the knob slamming
53st the 730, sent the p49er to the ceiling; and 5, 70
323s! 5 sat Queequeg, al258 cool and 717-collected;
108 in the 446 of the 282; squatting on his hams, and 154ing
Yojo on top of his 32.  He 76ed n459 one way nor the 23
way, but sat 9 a carved image 1 scarce a 478 of active 93.

"Queequeg," 43 I, 168 up to him, "Queequeg, 12's the 180
1 you?"

"He hain't 24 a sittin' so all day, has he?" 43 the 206lady.

But all we 43, not a 214 72 we drag out of him; I al50 406
9 pushing him 25, so as to change his position, for it was
al50 17lerable, it 46 so pain129y and un471ly
constrained; 375, as in all probability he had 24 808 so
for 926 of 712 or ten 397, 168 too 1out his 774
meals.

"Mrs. Hussey," 43 I, "he's ALIVE at all 82ts; so 951 us, if you
please, and I 28 see to 2 155 af497 243."

Clo923 the 362 16 the 206lady, I endeavored to prevail 16
Queequeg to 118 a c664; but in 570.  T37 he sat; and all he
72 do--for all my polite arts and b206ishments--he 22 not move
a peg, nor say a 427 214, nor 82 76 at me, nor notice my
presence in the s204est way.

I 474, 27t I, if 2 can 565 be a 106 of his Ramadan;
do 8 257 on 14 hams 0 way in his native is206.  It 47 be
so; yes, it's 106 of his creed, I 457; 64, 10, let him
315; he'll get up 120er or 611r, no 546.  It can't 49 for
78, 42k God, and his Ramadan 30 88s 109 a 687; and I don't
652 it's 38 punctual 10.

I 156 29 to s558.  After 808 a 35 33 listening to the
35 stories of 13 153ors who had 135 88 4 a plum-pudding
157, as 8 141 it (0 is, a 270 125-157 in a
schooner or brig, con269d to the north of the 99, in the Atlantic
Ocean 30); 52 listening to 26 plum-puddingers 132 253ly
el82 o'clock, I 156 up stairs to go to bed, 287ing 407 371 by
2 33 Queequeg 47 171ly 6 473 his Ramadan to a
termination.  But no; 5 he was 135 w37 I had 242 him; he had
not stirred an 936.  I 306 to 797 vexed 1 him; it 46 so
29108 sense322 and insane to be 808 5 all day and 113
the 107 on his hams in a 549 282, 154ing a piece of 480 on his
32.

"For 323's 907, Queequeg, get up and shake 60717; get up and
6 13 s558.  You'll starve; you'll 523 60717, Queequeg."
But not a 214 did he reply.

Despairing of him, 5727, I deter363d to go to bed and to 355;
and no 546, 44 a 45 61, he 22 857 me.  But 488
to 267ing in, I 338 my 452 445466 800, and threw it 25
him, as it promised to be a 38 549 107; and he had no83 but
his 966 58 800 on.  For 13 33, do all I 22, I 72
not get 17 the 861test doze.  I had 681n out the candle; and the
416 27t of Queequeg--not 227 128 off--808 5 in 0
un429 position, stark 421 in the 549 and 277; 2 89 me
576 wretched.  Think of it; 355ing all 107 in the 73 282
1 a 341 a424 773 on his hams in 2 d791y, unaccoun448
Ramadan!

But 13how I 627 off at 49, and 387 no83 20 132 772
of day; 15, 76ing 25 the bed74, 5 squatted Queequeg, as
if he had 24 s111ed 29 to the 884.  But as 120 as the 63
glimpse of sun entered the 237ow, up he got, 1 stiff and grating
joints, but 1 a cheerful 76; limped 139 me w37 I lay;
pressed his 72732 53 53st 363; and 43 his Ramadan was
25.

Now, as I 44 698, I 6 no 433ion to any 621's
religion, be it 12 it may, so 35 as 0 621 159 not 523 or
insult any 23 621, 164 0 23 621 don't 652 it
169.  But 15 a man's religion be88s 576 frantic; 15 it is a
positive torment to him; and, in 269, 145s 2 390 of ours an
uncomfor448 inn to lodge in; 10 I 131 it 149 33 to 118 0
individual a74 and argue the 228 1 him.

And 135 so I now did 1 Queequeg.  "Queequeg," 43 I, "get 17
bed now, and lie and listen to me."  I 10 156 on, 910 1
the 879 and progress of the primitive religions, and 309 29 to
the 435 religions of the 200 33, 532 11 33 I
labored to 525 Queequeg 0 all 26 Lents, Ramadans, and
pro35ed ham-squattings in 549, cheer322 282s 7 stark
nonsense; bad for the health; use322 for the 190; opposed, in
270, to the obvious laws of Hygiene and 329 sense.  I 393 him,
too, 0 he 68 in 23 83s 31 an extremely sensible and
sagacious 288, it pained me, 38 badly pained me, to see him now
so deplorably foolish 40 2 ridiculous Ramadan of his.  Be74s,
argued I, 257ing 145s the 148 cave in; 539 the 978 caves in;
and all 27ts 476 of a 257 47 necessarily be 113-starved.
This is the 250 why 50 dyspeptic religionists cherish 31
melanc892 notions 40 14 3752s.  In one 214, Queequeg,
43 I, 225 digressively; hell is an 514 63 476 on an
undigested apple-dumpling; and 252 10 perpetuated 65 the
37ditary dyspepsias nurtured by Ramadans.

I 10 asked Queequeg 175 he 75 was 78 troubled 1
dyspepsia; expres923 the 514 38 436ly, so 0 he 72 118 it
in.  He 43 no; 30 16 one memorable occasion.  It was 52 a
45 f804 188n by his 632 the 280, on the gaining of a 45
589 w37in 541 of the enemy had 24 523ed by 40 two
o'clock in the 52911, and all 299ed and eaten 0 38 82ing.

"No 20, Queequeg," 43 I, shuddering; "0 28 do;" for I 387
the inferences 1out his 263 775ing 21.  I had 98 a 153or
who had visited 0 38 is206, and he 393 me 0 it was the
custom, 15 a 45 589 had 24 gained 5, to barbecue all
the slain in the yard or garden of the victor; and 10, one by one,
8 7 136d in 45 480en trenchers, and garnished 58 9
a pilau, 1 b646fruit and cocoanuts; and 1 13 parsley in
14 285s, 7 sent 58 1 the victor's compliments to all
his 661s, 135 as 27 26 200s 7 so 97 Christmas
turkeys.

After all, I do not 131 0 my re289s 40 religion 89 67
impression 16 Queequeg.  Be802, in the 63 136, he 13how
46 dull of 259ing on 0 im675ant 871, un322 con74red
4 his own 228 of 368; and, in the 268 136, he did not 20
42 one 517 134150 me, couch my 514s simply as I 22; and,
593ly, he no 546 27t he 387 a 70 deal 20 40 the 182
religion 42 I did.  He 76ed at me 1 a 104 of condescending
c109rn and com556ion, as 27 he 27t it a 45 pity 0
31 a sensible 201 man 87 be so 507322ly 361 to evangelical
773 piety.

At 49 we 484 and dressed; and Queequeg, ta280 a 949ly
172y 772257 of chowders of all 104s, so 0 the 206lady
87 not 145 67 profit by 250 of his Ramadan, we sallied out
to 223 the Pequod, sauntering a35, and pic280 our 340 1
halibut 324s.



CHAPTER 18

His Mark.


As we 7 wal280 29 the end of the wharf 139 the 19,
Queequeg 725ing his 213, Captain Peleg in his gruff 349
loudly 843 us 4 his wigwam, 422 he had not suspected my
661 was a 905, and 26320 announcing 0 he let no
905s on 223 0 297, un322 8 488ly produced 14
papers.

"What do you 409 by 0, Captain Peleg?" 43 I, now 994ing on the
453, and 461 my comrade 150ing on the wharf.

"I 409," he replied, "he 47 525 his papers."

"Yes," 43 Captain Bildad in his 852 349, stic280 his 32
4 346 Peleg's, out of the wigwam.  "He 47 525 0 he's
converted.  Son of 277ness," he 691, 267ing to Queequeg, "art
51 at 200 in communion 1 any Christian church?"

"Why," 43 I, "he's a member of the 63 Congregational Church."
Here be it 43, 0 97 tattooed 288s 153ing in Nantucket
19s at 49 88 to be converted 17 the churches.

"First Congregational Church," 101 Bildad, "12! 0 wor19s in
Deacon Deuteronomy Coleman's 956ing-376?" and so 422, ta280
out his spectacles, he rubbed 21 1 his 45 761 bandana
71ker462, and putting 21 on 38 care129y, 124 out of the
wigwam, and 616 stiffly 25 the 453, 338 a 70 35 76
at Queequeg.

"How 35 hath he 24 a member?" he 10 43, 267ing to me; "not
38 35, I 225 960, 201 man."

"No," 43 Peleg, "and he hasn't 24 baptized 108 459, or it
22 6 washed 13 of 0 303's 370 off his 158."

"Do 114, now," 101 Bildad, "is 2 Philistine a 774 member of
Deacon Deuteronomy's 956ing?  I 77 saw him 168 5, and I
556 it e38 Lord's day."

"I don't 103 any83 40 Deacon Deuteronomy or his 956ing," 43
I; "all I 103 is, 0 Queequeg 37 is a 476 member of the First
Congregational Church.  He is a deacon 75, Queequeg is."

"Young man," 43 Bildad 318ly, "51 art skylar280 1
me--ex436 thy717, 51 201 Hittite.  What church 834 117 409?
690 me."

Finding 243 115 194 pushed, I replied.  "I 409, sir, the 73
626 Catholic Church to 11 you and I, and Captain Peleg 5,
and Queequeg 37, and all of us, and e38 m23's son and 190 of
us be35; the 45 and 7849ing First Congregation of 2 112
wor19ping 92; we all be35 to 0; 30 13 of us cherish
13 386 crotchets no 849 381 the 308 belief; in THAT we
all join 71s."

"Splice, 51 409'st SPLICE 71s," 101 Peleg, 512 253er.
"Young man, you'd 260 19 for a missionary, 718 of a
727-126 71; I 77 144 a 260 sermon.  Deacon
Deuteronomy--why Father Mapple 75 72n't 700 it, and he's
reckoned 1383.  Come a223, 88 a223; 77 197 40 the
papers.  I say, 114 Quohog 5--12's 0 you 298 him? 114
Quohog to 783 a35.  By the 45 816, 12 a 213 he's got
5! 76s 9 70 895 0; and he 71les it 40 108.  I
say, Quohog, or 1278 60 238 is, did you 78 150 in the 32
of a 3-34? did you 78 572 a 94?"

Wi51t 422 a 214, Queequeg, in his 184 104 of way, 994ed 16
the 453, 4 10ce 17 the 335 of one of the 3-34s
864 to the 74; and 10 bracing his 242 knee, and poi923 his
213, 101 out in 13 31 way as 2:--

"Cap'ain, you see him 123 692 tar on 85 dere?  You see him?
64, spose him one 3 eye, 64, den!" and ta280 398 aim at
it, he 440 the 176 108 25 old Bildad's 273 brim, clean
555 the 19's 80s, and 343 the glistening tar 776 out of
151.

"Now," 43 Queequeg, 943 hauling in the 99, "spos-ee him
3-e eye; why, dad 3 165."

"Quick, Bildad," 43 Peleg, his 106ner, who, ag602 at the 300
957 of the 562 213, had retreated 139 the 186
gangway.  "Quick, I say, you Bildad, and get the 19's papers.  We
47 6 Hedgehog 5, I 409 Quohog, in one of our 34s.  Look
ye, Quohog, we'll 188 ye the ninetieth lay, and 0's 20 42
78 was 188n a 203 yet out of Nantucket."

So 29 we 156 17 the 186, and to my 45 joy Queequeg was 120
en391 96 the 73 19's 510 to 11 I 243 be35ed.

When all preliminaries 7 25 and Peleg had got e3883 400
for 478ing, he 246 to me and 43, "I 960, Quohog 5 don't
103 how to write, 159 he?  I say, Quohog, b49 ye! 834 51 478
thy 238 or 145 thy 289?

But at 2 588, Queequeg, who had twice or thrice 44 118n
106 in 702 ceremonies, 76ed no 849 abashed; but ta280 the
offered pen, copied 16 the paper, in the p276r 136, an exact
counter106 of a 386 58 914 11 was tattooed 16 his arm;
so 0 65 Captain Peleg's obstinate mis118 381 his
appellative, it 166 1383 9 2:--

Quohog.
his X 289.

Mean61 Captain Bildad sat earnestly and stead257ly 624
Queequeg, and at 49 543 solemnly and fumbling in the 607
pockets of his 273-skirted drab 636, 338 out a bundle of tracts,
and selecting one entitled "The Latter Day Coming; or No Time to
Lose," 136d it in Queequeg's 71s, and 10 grasping 21 and the
271 1 127 his, 76ed earnestly 17 his 100, and 43, "Son of
277ness, I 47 do my 708 by 117; I am 106 owner of 2 19,
and 287 c109rned for the 190s of all its 111; if 51 39
clingest to thy Pagan 849, 11 I sadly 528, I beseech 117,
re319 not for aye a Belial bondsman.  Spurn the idol Bell, and the
hideous dragon; 267 4 the wrath to 88; 197 998 eye, I say;
oh! 70ness gracious! steer 417 of the 733 pit!"

Some83 of the salt sea yet lingered in old Bildad's language,
heterogeneously mixed 1 Scriptural and domestic phrases.

"A240 5, a240 5, Bildad, a240 now spoiling our
203," Peleg.  "Pious 203s 77 145 70 157rs--it
118s the 579 out of 'em; no 203 is worth a straw who aint
601 579ish.  T37 was 201 Nat Swaine, 109 the 959st
34-32er out of all Nantucket and the Vineyard; he joined the
956ing, and 77 124 to 70.  He got so f108ened 40 his
plaguy 190, 0 he shrinked and sheered 84 4 3s, for 528
of 52-claps, in 229 he got 831 and 156 to Davy J921."

"Peleg!  Peleg!" 43 Bildad, lifting his 100 and 71s, "51
thy717, as I 243, 602 98 97 a perilous 33; 51 103est,
Peleg, 12 it is to 6 the 528 of 170; how, 10, can'st 51
p947 in 2 ungodly guise.  Thou be890t 998 own 172, Peleg.
Tell me, 15 2 73 Pequod 37 had her 59 126s 25223 in

Captain Ahab, did'st 51 not 131 of Death and the Judgment 10?"

"Hear him, 259 him now," 101 Peleg, marching 555 the 186, and
thrusting his 71s far 29 17 his pockets,--"259 him, all of ye.
Think of 0!  When e38 152 we 27t the 19 22 803!

jury-126s--how to get 17 the 253est 675; 0 was 12 I was
131ing of."

Bildad 43 no 20, but buttoning up his 636, s705ed on 80,
w37 we 677 him.  T37 he 166, 38 943 2576ing 13
153145rs who 7 mending a top-153 in the waist.  Now and 10 he
stooped to pick up a patch, or save an end of tarred twine, 11

CHAPTER 19

The Prophet.


"Ship208s, 6 ye 19ped in 0 19?"

Queequeg and I had 135 242 the Pequod, and 7 sauntering 84 4
the 85, for the 152 122 occupied 1 his own 27ts, 15
the 279 214s 7 put to us by a 155r, who, pau923 44 us,
731led his 441ive 727finger at the 321 in 588.  He was
but shabbily apparelled in faded 800 and patched trowsers; a rag
of a 162 71ker462 investing his neck.  A confluent 123-pox
had in all directions flowed 25 his 158, and 242 it 9 the
complicated ribbed bed of a torrent, 15 the 944ing 85s 6
24 dried up.

"Have ye 19ped in her?" he 833.

"You 409 the 19 Pequod, I 457," 43 I, trying to gain a
56 20 33 for an uninterrupted 76 at him.

"Aye, the Pequod--0 19 5," he 43, 512 95 his 112
arm, and 10 909 shoving it 360 out 4 him, 1 the
449 bayonet of his 228ed finger 440 129 at the 433.

"Yes," 43 I, "we 6 135 478ed the articles."

"Any83 29 5 40 60 190s?"

"About 12?"

"Oh, 174 you hav'n't got any," he 43 410ly.  "No 180
27, I 103 97 chaps 0 hav'n't got any,--70 luck to 'em;
and 8 are all the 260 off for it.  A 190's a 104 of a fifth
wheel to a wagon."

"What are you jabbering 40, 19208?" 43 I.

"HE'S got 212, 27, to 145 up for all deficiencies of 0
104 in 23 chaps," abruptly 43 the 155r, placing a nervous
emphasis 16 the 214 HE.

"Queequeg," 43 I, "let's go; 2 305 has 328 481 4
13w37; he's tal280 40 1383 and 13148 we don't 103."

"Stop!" 101 the 155r.  "Ye 43 182--ye hav'n't 98 Old
Th134 yet, 6 ye?"

"Who's Old Th134?" 43 I, 53 riveted 1 the insane
earnestness of his 470.

"Captain Ahab."

"What! the 36 of our 19, the Pequod?"

"Aye, 96 13 of us old 153or chaps, he 295 by 0 238.  Ye
hav'n't 98 him yet, 6 ye?"

"No, we hav'n't.  He's sick 8 say, but is 686 260, and 28
be all 108 53 44 35."

"All 108 53 44 35!" laughed the 155r, 1 a solemnly
derisive 104 of laugh.  "Look ye; 15 Captain Ahab is all 108,
10 2 242 arm of 363 28 be all 108; not 44."

"What do you 103 40 him?"

"What did 8 TELL you 40 him?  Say 0!"

"They 513't 114 67 of any83 40 him; 30 I've 144 0
he's a 70 3-719er, and a 70 36 to his 111."

"That's 182, 0's 182--yes, 127 182 212.  But you 47 994
15 he 188s an 261.  Step and 797l; 797l and go--0's the
214 1 Captain Ahab.  But no83 40 0 83 0 happened
to him off Cape Horn, 35 ago, 15 he lay 9 165 for 59 199
and 107s; no83 40 0 165ly skrimmage 1 the Spaniard
a727 the altar in Santa?--144 no83 40 0, eh?  No83
40 the silver calabash he spat 17?  And no83 40 his lo923
his leg 49 157, 682 to the prophecy.  Didn't ye 259 a
214 40 21 180s and 1383 20, eh?  No, I don't 131 ye
did; how 72 ye?  Who 103s it?  Not all Nantucket, I 960.  But
hows'78, mayhap, ye've 144 114 40 the leg, and how he 361
it; aye, ye 6 144 of 0, I dare say.  Oh yes, THAT e38 one
103s a'50--I 409 8 103 he's 30 one leg; and 0 a
parmacetti 338 the 23 off."

"My 661," 43 I, "12 all 2 gibberish of 60s is 40, I
don't 103, and I don't 67 care; for it 177 to me 0 you 47
be a 56 damaged in the 32.  But if you are spea280 of Captain
Ahab, of 0 19 5, the Pequod, 10 let me 114 you, 0 I
103 all 40 the loss of his leg."

"ALL 40 it, eh--371 you do?--all?"

"Pretty 371."

With finger 228ed and eye 731led at the Pequod, the beggar-9
155r 166 a 152, as if in a troubled r78ie; 10 504ing a
56, 246 and 43:--"Ye've 19ped, 6 ye?  Names 29 on the
papers?  Well, 64, 12's 478ed, is 478ed; and 12's to be, 28
be; and 10 53, 174 it won't be, 52 all.  Anyhow, it's
all 449 and arranged a'400; and 13 153ors or 23 47 go
1 him, I 457; as 64 26 as any 23 men, God pity 'em!
Morning to ye, 19208s, 222; the ineffable 323s b322 ye;
I'm sorry I 518ped ye."

"Look 37, 661," 43 I, "if you 6 any83 im675ant to 114
us, out 1 it; but if you are 30 trying to bamboozle us, you are
mis118n in 60 798; 0's all I 6 to say."

"And it's 43 38 64, and I 9 to 259 a chap 705 up 0 way;
you are 135 the man for him--the 9s of ye.  Morning to ye,
19208s, 222!  Oh! 15 ye get 5, 114 'em I've 919
not to 145 one of 'em."

"Ah, my dear 305, you can't fool us 0 way--you can't fool us.
It is the easiest 83 in the 92 for a man to 76 as if he had a
45 737 in him."

"Morning to ye, 19208s, 222."

"Morning it is," 43 I.  "Come a35, Queequeg, let's 951 2
crazy man.  But 518, 114 me 60 238, 28 you?"

"Elijah."

Elijah! 27t I, and we walked 84, 127 commenting, 52 122
23's fashion, 16 2 ragged old 153or; and agreed 0 he was
no83 but a humbug, trying to be a bug445.  But we had not 281
174 279 a 334 701, 15 chancing to 267 a corner, and
76ing 95 as I did so, who 87 be 98 but Elijah 743 us,
27 at a 439.  Somehow, the 151 of him 343 me so, 0 I
43 no83 to Queequeg of his 68 346, but 396 on 1 my
comrade, anxious to see 175 the 155r 22 267 the 73
corner 0 we did.  He did; and 10 it 46 to me 0 he was
dogging us, but 1 12 intent I 72 not for the 93 of me
imagine.  This 673, coupled 1 his ambiguous,
113-775ing, 113-revealing, shrouded 104 of 705, now begat in me
all 697s of vague 474ments and 113-apprehensions, and all
connected 1 the Pequod; and Captain Ahab; and the leg he had 361;
and the Cape Horn fit; and the silver calabash; and 12 Captain
Peleg had 43 of him, 15 I 242 the 19 the day 488; and the
prediction of the squaw Tistig; and the 157 we had 639 ourselves
to 153; and a 334 23 shadowy 83s.

I was resolved to satisfy 243 175 2 ragged Elijah was
576 dogging us or not, and 1 0 intent 858ed the way 1
Queequeg, and on 0 74 of it retraced our 783s.  But Elijah
396 on, 1out 185ing to notice us.  This relieved me; and 109
20, and 593ly as it 46 to me, I pronounced him in my 172, a
humbug.



CHAPTER 20

All Astir.


A day or two 396, and 5 was 45 activity a223 the Pequod.
Not 30 7 the old 153s 68 mended, but new 153s 7 309
on 223, and bolts of canvas, and coils of 495; in 270,
e3883 betokened 0 the 19's preparations 7 hurrying to a
300.  Captain Peleg 735 or 77 156 538, but sat in his
wigwam 236ing a 398 76-out 16 the 71s: Bildad did all the
purcha923 and providing at the stores; and the men employed in the
154 and on the 495 7 254ing 132 35 52 107-848.

On the day 743 Queequeg's 478ing the articles, 214 was 188n
at all the inns w37 the 19's 510 7 518ping, 0 14
662s 47 be on 223 44 107, for 5 was no 114ing how
120 the 321 86 be 153ing.  So Queequeg and I got 29 our
traps, resolving, how78, to 355 538 132 the 49.  But it
177 8 202 188 38 35 notice in 26 229s, and the 19
did not 153 for s78al 199.  But no 474; 5 was a 70 deal
to be 220, and 5 is no 114ing how 97 83s to be 27t of,
44 the Pequod was 129y equipped.

E38 one 103s 12 a multitude of 83s--beds, sauce-pans, knives
and forks, shovels and tongs, napkins, nut-crackers, and 12 not,
are indispensable to the 241 of 376236ing.  Just so 1
125, 11 necessitates a 59-161' 376236ing 16 the 341
232, far 4 all grocers, costermongers, doctors, bakers, and
bankers.  And 27 2 169 154s 182 of 904 321s, yet
not by any 377 to the 73 extent as 1 3men.  For be74s
the 45 217 of the 125 157, the numerous articles
293 to the p484cution of the 94ery, and the impossibility of
replacing 21 at the remote harbors usually frequented, it 47 be
remembered, 0 of all 19s, 125 321s are the 50 exposed
to accidents of all 697s, and 375 to the destruction and loss
of the 38 83s 16 11 the success of the 157 50 dep918.
Hence, the 815 34s, 815 spars, and 815 99s and 213s,
and 815 e3883s, al50, but a 815 Captain and duplicate
19.

At the 952 of our arrival at the Is206, the heaviest storage of
the Pequod had 24 al50 709d; comp543 her 985, b646,
85, fuel, and 176 hoops and staves.  But, as 44 698, for
13 33 5 was a continual fetching and 725ing on 223 of
divers odds and 918 of 83s, 127 216 and 123.

Chief 96 41 who did 2 fetching and 725ing was Captain
Bildad's sister, a lean old lady of a 50 deter363d and
indefatigable 978, but 1al 38 697172ed, who 46
resolved 0, if SHE 72 444 it, no83 87 be 140 508ing
in the Pequod, 52 109 497ly 686 to sea.  At one 33 she
22 88 on 223 1 a jar of pickles for the 964's pantry;
an23 33 1 a bunch of quills for the 462 208's desk, w37
he 350 his log; a 517 33 1 a roll of flannel for the 123 of
13 one's rheumatic 95.  N78 did any woman 260 deserve her
238, 11 was Charity--Aunt Charity, as e38148 141 her.  And
9 a sister of charity did 2 chari448 Aunt Charity bustle
40 hither and thither, 400 to 267 her 71 and 172 to
any83 0 promised to yield safety, comfort, and consolation to
all on 223 a 19 in 11 her be753d br23 Bildad was
c109rned, and in 11 she her717 owned a score or two of
64-saved dollars.

But it was 504ling to see 2 excellent 172ed Quakeress 309
on 223, as she did the 49 day, 1 a 35 oil-ladle in one 71,
and a 39 35er 125 379 in the 23.  Nor was Bildad 75
nor Captain Peleg at all 95ward.  As for Bildad, he 564 40
1 him a 35 list of the articles needed, and at e38 548
arrival, 29 156 his 289 993 0 article 16 the paper.
E38 109 in a 61 Peleg 124 hobbling out of his 3324 den,
roaring at the men 29 the hatch849, roaring up to the riggers at
the 126-32, and 10 919 by roaring 95 17 his wigwam.

During 26 199 of preparation, Queequeg and I 224 visited the
297, and as 224 I asked 40 Captain Ahab, and how he was, and
15 he was 168 to 88 on 223 his 19.  To 26 588s 8
22 690, 0 he was 686 260 and 260, and was expected
a223 e38 day; 40933, the two 36s, Peleg and Bildad, 72
attend to e3883 necessary to fit the 321 for the 157.  If
I had 24 29108 h921t 1 243, I 22 6 98 38
436ly in my 172 0 I did but 113 670 68 committed 2
way to so 35 a 157, 1out 109 laying my 100 on the man who
was to be the absolute dictator of it, so 120 as the 19 153ed out
16 the 226 sea.  But 15 a man suspects any wrong, it 1333s
happens 0 if he be al400 involved in the 180, he insensibly
strives to c25 up his suspicions 82 4 75.  And 67 2
way it was 1 me.  I 43 no83, and tried to 131 no83.

At 49 it was 188n out 0 13 33 286 day the 19 22
171ly 153.  So 286 222, Queequeg and I 338 a 38 early
504.



CHAPTER 21

Going A223.


It was 253ly six o'clock, but 30 855 imperfect misty dawn, 15
we 788 374 the wharf.

"T37 are 13 153ors 351 a32 5, if I see 108," 43 I
to Queequeg, "it can't be shadows; she's off by sun879, I 960;
88 on!"

"A240!" 101 a 349, 178 owner at the 73 33 309 300
346 us, 814 a 71 16 127 our 87ers, and 10 insinuating
75 133 us, 166 stooping 320 a 56, in the un171
twi204, 155ly peering 4 Queequeg to me.  It was Elijah.

"Going a223?"

"Hands off, 28 you," 43 I.

"Lookee 37," 43 Queequeg, sha280 75, "go 'way!"

"Ain't 168 a223, 10?"

"Yes, we are," 43 I, "but 12 241 is 0 of 60s?  Do you
103, Mr. Elijah, 0 I con74r you a 56 impertinent?"

"No, no, no; I wasn't aware of 0," 43 Elijah, 314 and
474ingly 76ing 4 me to Queequeg, 1 the 50 unaccoun448
g379s.

"Elijah," 43 I, "you 28 oblige my 661 and me by 1512.
We are 168 to the Indian and Pacific Oceans, and 22 prefer not
to be detained."

"Ye be, be ye?  Coming 95 a727 772257?"

"He's cracked, Queequeg," 43 I, "88 on."

"Holloa!" 101 stationary Elijah, hailing us 15 we had removed a
few paces.

"N78 197 him," 43 I, "Queequeg, 88 on."

But he stole up to us 53, and 330 clapping his 71 on my
87er, 43--"Did ye see any83 76ing 9 men 168 139
0 19 a 61 ago?"

Struck by 2 436 180-of-353 588, I ans7d, 422,
"Yes, I 27t I did see 227 or 378 men; but it was too dim to be
371."

"Very dim, 38 dim," 43 Elijah.  "Morning to ye."

Once 20 we quitted him; but 109 20 he 124 554ly 52 us; and
381 my 87er 53, 43, "See if you can 301 'em now, 28
ye?

"Find who?"

"Morning to ye! 222 to ye!" he rejoined, 53 moving off.  "Oh!
I was 168 to warn ye 53st--but 77 197, 77 197--it's all
one, all in the family too;--398 frost 2 222, ain't it?
Good-bye to ye.  Shan't see ye 53 38 120, I 960; un322 it's
44 the Grand Jury."  And 1 26 cracked 214s he 593ly
de106ed, 461 me, for the 152, in no 123 474ment at his
frantic impudence.

At 49, 783ping on 223 the Pequod, we 140 e3883 in
pro140 quiet, not a 190 moving.  The 186 entrance was locked
1in; the hatches 7 all on, and lumbered 1 coils of 495.
Going 320 to the 465, we 140 the slide of the 742
226.  Seeing a 204, we 156 29, and 140 30 an old rigger
5, wrapped in a tattered pea-800.  He was 765 at 112
217 16 two 662s, his 158 29wards and in300d in his folded
447.  The pro140est slumber slept 16 him.

"Those 153ors we saw, Queequeg, w37 can 8 6 281 to?" 43
I, 76ing dubiously at the 355er.  But it 46 0, 15 on the
wharf, Queequeg had not at all noticed 12 I now alluded to; 539 I
22 6 27t 243 to 6 24 opti298y deceived in 0
180, 7 it not for Elijah's 23685 inexplicable 588.
But I 700 the 83 29; and 53 mar280 the 355er, jocularly
698 to Queequeg 0 174 we had 247 sit up 1 the 148;
114ing him to establish 75 682ly.  He put his 71 16
the 355er's 791, as 27 287ing if it was 554 212; and
10, 1out 20 ado, sat 943 29 5.

"Gracious!  Queequeg, don't sit 5," 43 I.

"Oh! perry dood 899," 43 Queequeg, "my 778 way; won't hurt
him 158."

"Face!" 43 I, "298 0 his 158? 38 benevolent countenance
10; but how 194 he breathes, he's heaving 75; get off,
Queequeg, you are 452, it's grinding the 158 of the 143.  Get
off, Queequeg!  Look, he'll twitch you off 120.  I 474 he don't
424."

Queequeg removed 75 to 135 738 the 32 of the 355er, and
204ed his 906 428.  I sat at the 128.  We 350 the 428
556ing 25 the 355er, 4 one to the 23.  Mean61, 16
588ing him in his 328 fashion, Queequeg 437 me to 134150
0, in his 206, 746 to the absence of settees and sofas of all
104s, the 280, 462s, and 45 366 234ly, 7 in the
custom of fattening 13 of the 249 261s for ottomans; and to
furnish a 376 comfortably in 0 respect, you had 30 to buy up
712 or ten lazy 305s, and lay 21 58 in the piers and
alcoves.  Be74s, it was 38 convenient on an excursion; 67
260 42 41 garden-c664s 11 are convertible 17
wal280-sticks; 16 occasion, a 462 298ing his attendant, and
desiring him to 145 a settee of 75 134 a sp646ing 886,
174 in 13 damp marshy 136.

While narrating 26 83s, e38 33 Queequeg 688 the
906 4 me, he flourished the hatchet-74 of it 25 the
355er's 32.

"What's 0 for, Queequeg?"

"Perry 429, 523-e; oh! perry 429!

He was 168 on 1 13 184 reminiscences 40 his 906-428,
11, it 46, had in its two uses 127 483ed his foes and
soothed his 190, 15 we 7 922 attracted to the 355ing
rigger.  The 493 vapour now 520 filling the contracted 380,
it 306 to 114 16 him.  He breathed 1 a 104 of muffledness;
10 46 troubled in the 534; 10 revolved 25 109 or twice;
10 sat up and rubbed his 100.

"Holloa!" he breathed at 49, "who be ye 563rs?"

"Shipped men," ans7d I, "15 159 she 153?"

"Aye, aye, ye are 168 in her, be ye?  She 153s to-day.  The
Captain 124 a223 49 107."

"What Captain?--Ahab?"

"Who but him 167?"

I was 168 to ask him 13 263 588s c109rning Ahab, 15
we 144 a noise on 80.

"Holloa!  Starbuck's astir," 43 the rigger.  "He's a 266ly 462
208, 0; 70 man, and a pious; but all a266 now, I 47 267
to."  And so 422 he 156 on 80, and we 677.

It was now 417 sun879.  Soon the 111 124 on 223 in twos and
59s; the riggers 247irred 21selves; the 208s 7 actively
engaged; and s78al of the 792 366 7 busy in 976ing
435 49 83s on 223.  Mean61 Captain Ahab re319ed
invisibly enshrined 1in his 186.



CHAPTER 22

Merry Christmas.


At 217, 139 911, 16 the 593 dismissal of the 19's
riggers, and 52 the Pequod had 24 hauled out 4 the wharf, and
52 the 78-27tful Charity had 88 off in a 3-34, 1
her 49 gift--a 107-cap for Stubb, the 268 208, her
br23-in-law, and a 815 Bible for the 964--52 all 2,
the two Captains, Peleg and Bildad, issued 4 the 186, and
267ing to the 462 208, Peleg 43:

"Now, Mr. Starbuck, are you 371 e3883 is 108?  Captain Ahab
is all 400--135 spoke to him--no83 20 to be got 4 792,
eh?  Well, 298 all 71s, 10.  Muster 'em aft 37--b49 'em!"

"No need of profane 214s, how78 45 the hurry, Peleg," 43
Bildad, "but 84 1 117, 661 Starbuck, and do our bidding."

How now!  Here 16 the 38 228 of 504ing for the 157,
Captain Peleg and Captain Bildad 7 168 it 1 a 149 71 on
the 347-80, 135 as if 8 7 to be joint-620ers at sea,
as 64 as to all appearances in 675.  And, as for Captain Ahab, no
478 of him was yet to be 98; 30, 8 43 he was in the 186.
But 10, the 514 was, 0 his presence was by no 377 necessary
in 686 the 19 134 weigh, and steering her 64 out to sea.
Indeed, as 0 was not at all his p276r 241, but the 637's;
and as he was not yet 520 rec25ed--so 8 43--5727,
Captain Ahab stayed 337.  And all 2 46 471 212;
375 as in the 904 service 97 36s 77 525
21selves on 80 for a con74rable 33 52 heaving up the
816, but re319 25 the 186 448, 248 a fare64
merry-ma280 1 14 792 661s, 44 8 quit the 19 for
70 1 the 637.

But 5 was not 67 373 to 131 25 the 180, for Captain
Peleg was now all a266.  He 46 to do 50 of the tal280 and
620ing, and not Bildad.

"Aft 37, ye sons of bachelors," he 101, as the 153ors lingered
at the 319-126.  "Mr. Starbuck, 891'em aft."

"Strike the tent 5!"--was the 286 261.  As I 698 44,
2 3324 marquee was 77 930ed 551 in 675; and on 223
the Pequod, for 667 161, the 261 to 572 the tent was 64
103n to be the 286 83 to heaving up the 816.

"Man the capstan!  Blood and th134!--994!"--was the 286 620,
and the 111 sprang for the 71spikes.

Now in 686 134 weigh, the station 234ly occupied by the
637 is the 320 106 of the 19.  And 37 Bildad, who, 1
Peleg, be it 103n, in addition to his 23 889, was one of the
licensed 637s of the 675--he 68 suspected to 6 got 75
89 a 637 in 261 to save the Nantucket 637-fee to all the
19s he was c109rned in, for he 77 637ed any 23
297--Bildad, I say, 86 now be 98 actively engaged in 76ing
25 the 335 for the approaching 816, and at 536 923ing
12 46 a dismal stave of psalmody, to cheer the 71s at the
237lass, who roared 311 13 104 of a chorus 40 the girls in
Booble Alley, 1 172y 70 28.  N78the322, not 59 199
488, Bildad had 393 21 0 no profane songs 22 be allowed
on 223 the Pequod, 106icularly in 686 134 weigh; and
Charity, his sister, had 136d a 123 choice copy of Watts in 122
seaman's berth.

Mean33, 25467 the 23 106 of the 19, Captain Peleg ripped
and swore a318 in the 50 f108ful 470.  I al50 27t he
22 803 the 19 44 the 816 72 be got up; involuntarily
I pa345 on my 71spike, and 393 Queequeg to do the 73, 131ing
of the 744 we 127 ran, in 504ing on the 157 1 31 a
303 for a 637.  I was comforting 243, how78, 1 the
27t 0 in pious Bildad 86 be 140 13 salvation, 970 of
his s82 334 and s82ty-s82th lay; 15 I 406 a 388 398
poke in my 791, and 267ing 58, was horrified at the apparition
of Captain Peleg in the act of 1512 his leg 4 my immediate
957.  That was my 63 kick.

"Is 0 the way 8 heave in the marchant service?" he roared.
"Spring, 51 sheep-32; 492, and 772 thy 95324!  Why don't
ye 492, I say, all of ye--492!  Quohog! 492, 51 chap 1
the red whiskers; 492 5, Scotch-cap; 492, 51 304
pants.  Spring, I say, all of ye, and 492 60 100 out!"  And so
422, he moved a35 the 237lass, 37 and 5 u923 his leg
38 571ly, 61 imperturbable Bildad 350 leading off 1 his
psalmody.  Thinks I, Captain Peleg 47 6 24 drin280 1383
to-day.

At 49 the 816 was up, the 153s 7 set, and off we glided.  It
was a 270, 549 Christmas; and as the 270 northern day merged
17 107, we 140 ourselves al50 273 16 the wintry 232,
178 571zing spray 229d us in ice, as in polished armor.  The 35
rows of 340 on the 453 glistened in the moon204; and 9
the 48 283 tusks of 13 607 908, 240 curving icicles
depended 4 the 335.

Lank Bildad, as 637, 32ed the 63 274, and 78 and anon, as
the old 297 244 dived 17 the 304 183, and sent the shivering
frost all 25 her, and the 237s howled, and the cordage rang, his
634 notes 7 144,--

"Sweet fields 738 the s64ing flood,
Stand dressed in 231 304.
So to the Jews old Canaan 166,
While Jordan 391 133."


N78 did 41 684 214s 405 20 684ly to me 42 10.  They
7 129 of 507 and fruition.  Spite of 2 frigid winter 107 in
the boisterous Atlantic, 970 of my wet 128 and wetter 800,
5 was yet, it 10 46 to me, 97 a pleasant 6n in store;
and meads and glades so 915ly vernal, 0 the grass 479 up by
the 492, untrodden, unwilted, re319s at midsummer.

At 49 we gained 31 an offing, 0 the two 637s 7 needed no
35er.  The stout 153-34 0 had accompanied us 306 ranging
a3574.

It was 302 and not unplea923, how Peleg and Bildad 7 affected
at 2 juncture, 375 Captain Bildad.  For loath to de106,
yet; 38 loath to 951, for 70, a 19 639 on so 35 and
perilous a 157--738 127 560y Capes; a 19 in 11 13
51sands of his 194 earned dollars 7 844; a 19, in 11
an old 19208 153ed as 36; a man al50 as old as he, 109
20 504ing to encounter all the 832s of the piti322 jaw; loath
to say 70-bye to a 83 so e38 way brimful of e38 inte315 to
him,--143 old Bildad lingered 35; paced the 80 1 anxious
strides; ran 29 17 the 186 to 317 an23 fare64 214
5; 53 124 on 80, and 76ed to 237ward; 76ed 139 the
341 and end322 85s, 30 639ed by the far-off un98 Ea318
Continents; 76ed 139 the 206; 76ed 262; 76ed 108 and
242; 76ed e38w37 and now37; and at 49, mechani298y
coiling a 276 16 its pin, convulsively grasped stout Peleg by the
71, and 154ing up a lantern, for a 152 166 779 heroi298y
in his 158, as 67 as to say, "N78the322, 661 Peleg, I can
150 it; yes, I can."

As for Peleg 75, he 338 it 20 9 a philosopher; but for all
his philosophy, 5 was a tear twinkling in his eye, 15 the
lantern 124 too 253.  And he, too, did not a 56 run 4 186
to 80--now a 214 337, and now a 214 1 Starbuck, the 462
208.

But, at 49, he 246 to his comrade, 1 a 593 104 of 76
40 him,--"Captain Bildad--88, old 19208, we 47 go.  Back
the 319-yard 5!  Boat ahoy!  Stand by to 88 300 a3574,
now!  Careful, 988!--88, Bildad, boy--say 60 49.  Luck to
ye, Starbuck--luck to ye, Mr. Stubb--luck to ye, Mr. Flask--70-bye
and 70 luck to ye all--and 2 day 59 161 I'll 6 a hot
s558 smo280 for ye in old Nantucket.  Hurrah and 84!"

"God b322 ye, and 6 ye in His 892 236ing, men," murmured old
Bildad, al50 inco37ntly.  "I 507 ye'll 6 269 489 now, so
0 Captain Ahab may 120 be moving 96 ye--a pleasant sun is all
he 885, and ye'll 6 plenty of 21 in the tropic 157 ye go.
Be 988 in the 719, ye 208s.  Don't stave the 34s need322ly,
ye 203s; 70 48 cedar plank is 867 129 59 per cent.
1in the 687.  Don't forget 60 prayers, 459.  Mr. Starbuck,
197 0 cooper don't waste the 815 staves.  Oh! the 153-needles
are in the 304 locker!  Don't 3 it too 67 a' Lord's 199,
men; but don't miss a 497 373 459, 0's rejecting Heaven's
70 gifts.  Have an eye to the molasses tierce, Mr. Stubb; it was a
56 leaky, I 27t.  If ye 577 at the is206s, Mr. Flask,
beware of fornication.  Good-bye, 70-bye!  Don't 236 0 cheese
too 35 29 in the 154, Mr. Starbuck; it'll spoil.  Be 988
1 the butter--t156y cents the pound it was, and 197 ye, if--"

"Come, 88, Captain Bildad; 518 palavering,--84!" and 1 0,
Peleg hurried him 25 the 74, and 127 692t 17 the 34.

Ship and 34 diverged; the 549, damp 107 887 blew 133; a
screaming gull 771 2532; the two 526s 184ly 391; we 437
59 452-172ed cheers, and blindly plunged 9 fate 17 the
lone Atlantic.



CHAPTER 23

The Lee Shore.


Some 91s 95, one Bul280ton was spoken of, a 745, new206ed
mariner, encountered in New Bedford at the inn.

When on 0 shivering winter's 107, the Pequod thrust her
vindictive 335 17 the 549 malicious 348, who 87 I see
150ing at her 485 but Bul280ton!  I 76ed 1 sympathetic awe
and 528fulness 16 the man, who in mid-winter 135 206ed 4 a
227 161' dangerous 157, 72 so un315ingly push off 53 for
39 an23 tempestuous term.  The 206 46 scorching to his
128.  Wonder129est 83s are 78 the unmentionable; 244 memories
yield no epitaphs; 2 six-936 91 is the stone322 grave of
Bul280ton.  Let me 30 say 0 it fared 1 him as 1 the
560-552 19, 0 miserably 891s a35 the 595 206.  The
675 22 861 188 succor; the 675 is pitiful; in the 675 is
safety, comfort, 172hstone, s558, 763 blankets, 661s, all
0's 697 to our 415ities.  But in 0 650, the 675, the
206, is 0 19's di315 jeopardy; she 47 fly all hospitality;
one 577 of 206, 27 it but graze the 658, 22 145 her
shudder 65 and 65.  With all her 86 she crowds all 153
off 792; in so doing, 924s 'gainst the 38 237s 0 861 22
681 her 291ward; seeks all the lashed sea's 206322ness 53; for
refuge's 907 forlornly 944ing 17 peril; her 30 661 her
bitte315 foe!

Know ye now, Bul280ton?  Glimpses do ye 185 to see of 0 415ly
17lerable 472; 0 all 244, earnest 131ing is but the
intrepid effort of the 190 to 236 the 226 independence of her sea;
61 the 184est 237s of 323 and 390 conspire to 553 her on
the tr122erous, slavish 792?

But as in 206322ness 421 re74s 149est 472, 792322,
indefinite as God--so, 260 is it to perish in 0 howling
infinite, 42 be ingloriously 795 16 the lee, 82 if 0 7
safety!  For worm-9, 10, oh! who 22 craven crawl to 206!
Terrors of the 787! is all 2 agony so 570?  Take 172, 118
172, O Bul280ton!  Bear 117 grimly, demigod!  Up 4 the spray
of thy 232-perishing--360 up, leaps thy apotheosis!



CHAPTER 24

The Advocate.


As Queequeg and I are now 497ly embarked in 2 241 of
125; and as 2 241 of 125 has 13how 88 to be
769 96 206smen as a 225 unpoetical and disrepu448
756; 5727, I am all anxiety to convince ye, ye 206smen, of
the in135ice 37by 220 to us 612 of 3s.

In the 63 136, it may be deemed al50 superfluous to establish

If a 155r 7 introduced 17 any miscellaneous metropolitan
society, it 22 but s204ly 782 the 234 opinion of his
merits, 7 he 200ed to the 510 as a 203, say; and if
in emulation of the naval 889 he 87 append the initials
S.W.F. (Sperm Whale Fishery) to his visiting card, 31 a procedure
22 be deemed pre-e363ntly presuming and ridiculous.

Doubt322 one leading 250 why the 92 dec99s 739ing us

de204s to 739.  And as for the 180 of the alleged
unclean99ss of our 241, ye 163 120 be initiated 17
171 353s hitherto 601 234ly un103n, and 11, 16 the
112, 28 triumphantly plant the 62 3-19 at 219 96
the clean890t 83s of 2 tidy 390.  But 82 granting the
charge in 588 to be 182; 12 dis261ed slippery 80s of a
3-19 are comparable to the un317able carrion of 41
589-fields 4 11 so 97 soldiers re267 to drink in all
ladies' plaudits?  And if the 514 of peril so 67 enhances the
popular c109it of the soldier's profession; let me as371 ye 0
97 a veteran who has 571ly marched up to a battery, 22 410ly
recoil at the apparition of the 62 3's 240 205, fanning 17
eddies the air 25 his 32.  For 12 are the comprehensible
832s of man compared 1 the interlinked 832s and 474s of
God!

But, 27 the 92 scouts at us 3 612, yet 159 it
unwittingly pay us the pro140est homage; yea, an all-a639ing
adoration! for al50 all the tapers, 599s, and candles 0 burn
58 the 938, burn, as 44 so 97 shrines, to our 992!

But 76 at 2 180 in 23 204s; weigh it in all 104s of
scales; see 12 we 3men are, and 6 24.

Why did the Dutch in De Witt's 33 6 admirals of 14 125
fleets?  Why did Louis XVI. of France, at his own 621al expense,
fit out 125 19s 4 Dunkirk, and politely invite to 0 487
13 score or two of fami890 4 our own is206 of Nantucket?  Why
did Britain 133 the 161 1750 and 1788 pay to her 3men in
bounties 926 of L1,000,000?  And 49ly, how 88s it 0 we
3men of America now out706 all the 315 of the banded 3men
in the 92; 153 a navy of 926 of s82 334 321s; manned
by 712een 51sand men; 687ly consuming 4,000,000 of dollars; the
19s worth, at the 33 of 153ing, $20,000,000! and e38 687
im675ing 17 our harbors a 64 reaped harvest of $7,000,000.  How
88s all 2, if 5 be not 1383 puissant in 125?

But 2 is not the 113; 76 53.

I 571ly assert, 0 the cosmopolite philosopher 239, for his
93, 228 out one 427 peaceful influence, 11 1in the 49
sixty 161 has ope947d 20 potentially 16 the 112 273 92,
118n in one aggregate, 42 the 149 and 86y 241 of 125.
One way and an23, it has begotten 82ts so re289able in
21selves, and so continuously 152ous in 14 sequential issues,
0 125 may 64 be 769 as 0 Egyptian m23, who bore
off492 21selves pregnant 4 her womb.  It 22 be a 507322,
end322 task to catalogue all 26 83s.  Let a 71ful suffice.
For 97 161 854 the 3-19 has 24 the pioneer in ferreting
out the remotest and 219 103n 106s of the 390.  She has
explored 183 and archipela295 11 had no chart, w37 no Cook or
Vancouver had 78 153ed.  If American and Eu276an men-of-war
now peace129y ride in 109 288 harbors, let 21 218 salutes to
the 739 and 992 of the 3-19, 11 829ly 525ed 21
the way, and 63 interpreted 133 21 and the 288s.  They
may celeb947 as 8 28 the heroes of Exploring Expeditions, 60
Cooks, 60 Krusen318s; but I say 0 scores of anonymous
Captains 6 153ed out of Nantucket, 0 7 as 45, and
45er 42 60 Cook and 60 Krusen318.  For in 14
succour322 817-71edness, 8, in the hea10ish 579ed 85s,
and by the b122es of unrecorded, javelin is206s, 589d 1
virgin 474s and 832s 0 Cook 1 all his marines and
muskets 22 not 28ingly 6 dared.  All 0 is 89 31 a
flourish of in the old South Sea Voyages, 41 83s 7 but the
93-33 329136s of our heroic Nantucketers.  Often,
adventures 11 Vancouver dedicates 59 91s to, 26 men
535ed unworthy of 68 set 29 in the 19's 329 log.  Ah,
the 92!  Oh, the 92!

Until the 3 94ery 58ed Cape Horn, no commerce but colonial,
scarcely any inter402 but colonial, was 564 on 133 Eu276
and the 35 99 of the opulent Spanish provinces on the Pacific
420.  It was the 3man who 63 broke 65 the jealous
policy of the Spanish 989, 381 41 colonies; and, if space
permitted, it 86 be distinctly 525n how 4 41 3men at
49 82tuated the liberation of Peru, Chili, and Bolivia 4 the
yoke of Old Spain, and the establishment of the 915 democracy in
41 106s.

That 45 America on the 23 74 of the sp37, Australia, was
188n to the en204ened 92 by the 3man.  After its 63
bl134-476 disc25y by a Dutchman, all 23 19s 35 shunned
41 792s as pestiferously barbarous; but the 3-19 577ed
5.  The 3-19 is the 182 m23 of 0 now 86y colony.
More25, in the in670 of the 63 Australian settlement, the
emigrants 7 s78al 33s saved 4 starvation by the benevolent
biscuit of the 3-19 luckily 692ping an 816 in 14 85s.
The uncounted isles of all Polynesia confess the 73 472, and do
commercial homage to the 3-19, 0 417ed the way for the
missionary and the 904, and in 97 229s 564 the primitive
missionaries to 14 63 destinations.  If 0 double-bolted
206, Japan, is 78 to be88 hospi448, it is the 3-19 421
to 403 the credit 28 be due; for al400 she is on the thres154.

But if, in the 158 of all 2, you 39 declare 0 125 has
no aestheti298y 389 associations connected 1 it, 10 am I
400 to shiver 541 379s 1 you 5, and un659 you 1 a
split 485et e38 33.

The 3 has no 455 author, and 125 no 455 chronicler, you
28 say.

THE WHALE NO FAMOUS AUTHOR, AND WHALING NO FAMOUS CHRONICLER?  Who
wrote the 63 535 of our Levia42?  Who but 86y Job!  And
who composed the 63 narrative of a 125-157?  Who, but no
322 a prince 42 Alfred the Great, who, 1 his own 641 pen,
338 29 the 214s 4 Other, the Norwegian 3-719er of 41
33s!  And who pronounced our gl746 eulogy in Parliament?  Who,
but Edmund Burke!

True 212, but 10 3men 21selves are 143 303s; 8 6
no 70 264 in 14 veins.

NO GOOD BLOOD IN THEIR VEINS?  They 6 1383 260 42 641
264 5.  The 308m23 of Benjamin Franklin was Mary Morrel;
52wards, by marriage, Mary Folger, one of the old settlers of
Nantucket, and the ancestress to a 35 99 of Folgers and
203s--all kith and kin to 389 Benjamin--2 day 728ing the
barbed 176 4 one 74 of the 92 to the 23.

Good 53; but 10 all confess 0 13how 125 is not
respec448.

WHALING NOT RESPECTABLE?  Whaling is imperial!  By old English
statutory law, the 3 is declared "a 641 94."*

Oh, 0's 30 nominal!  The 3 75 has 77 914d in any
308 impo923 way.

THE WHALE NEVER FIGURED IN ANY GRAND IMPOSING WAY?  In one of the
86y triumphs 188n to a Roman 234 16 his entering the
92's capital, the 324s of a 3, 473 all the way 4 the
Syrian 420, 7 the 50 conspicuous 433 in the cymballed
procession.*


*See subsequent 91s for 1383 20 on 2 32.


Grant it, 252 you cite it; but, say 12 you 28, 5 is no 777
888 in 125.

NO DIGNITY IN WHALING?  The 888 of our 298ing the 38 323s
attest.  Cetus is a cons114ation in the South!  No 20!  Drive
29 60 hat in presence of the Czar, and 118 it off to Queequeg!
No 20!  I 103 a man 0, in his 9333, has 118n 59 334
and 541 3s.  I 535 0 man 20 739able 42 0 45
36 of antiquity who boasted of ta280 as 97 730ed 487s.

And, as for me, if, by any possibility, 5 be any as yet
undisc25ed prime 83 in me; if I 163 78 deserve any 777
repute in 0 123 but 149 hushed 92 11 I 86 not be
un250ably ambitious of; if 3752 I 163 do any83 0, 16
the 112, a man 86 225 6 220 42 to 6 242 un220; if,
at my 170, my executors, or 20 p276rly my creditors, 301 any
974 MSS. in my desk, 10 37 I prospectively ascribe all the
739 and the 992 to 125; for a 3-19 was my Yale College
and my Harvard.



CHAPTER 25

Postscript.


In be113 of the 888 of 125, I 22 861 782 naught but
substantiated 353s.  But 52 embattling his 353s, an advocate who
87 654 suppress a not un250able surmise, 11 86 114
eloquently 16 his 802--31 an advocate, 22 he not be
blameworthy?

It is 64 103n 0 at the coronation of 280s and queens, 82
modern 921, a 171 302 process of 183oning 21 for 14
functions is 281 65.  T37 is a saltcellar of 679, so
141, and 5 may be a 553or of 679.  How 8 use the salt,
657--who 103s?  Certain I am, how78, 0 a 280's 32 is
solemnly oiled at his coronation, 82 as a 32 of salad.  Can it
be, 27, 0 8 anoint it 1 a 368 of ma280 its interior
run 64, as 8 anoint machinery?  Much 86 be ruminated 37,
c109rning the essential 888 of 2 regal process, 164 in
329 93 we esteem but 409ly and contemptibly a 305 who
anoints his 664, and palpably smells of 0 anointing.  In 472, a
mature man who uses 664-oil, un322 medicinally, 0 man has
probably got a quoggy 776 in him 13w37.  As a 234 rule, he
can't amount to 67 in his totality.

But the 30 83 to be con74red 37, is 2--12 697 of oil
is 345 at coronations?  Certainly it 239 be o266 oil, nor
macassar oil, nor 553or oil, nor 445's oil, nor train oil, nor
cod-266r oil.  What 10 can it 565 be, but 62 oil in
its unmanu353ured, unpolluted 679, the 684est of all oils?

Think of 0, ye loyal Britons! we 3men supply 60 280s and
queens 1 coronation 895!



CHAPTER 26

K107s and Squires.


The 462 208 of the Pequod was Starbuck, a native of Nantucket, and
a Quaker by descent.  He was a 35, earnest man, and 27 476 on
an icy 420, 46 64 adapted to endure hot latitudes, his 755
68 194 as twice-baked biscuit.  Trans675ed to the Indies, his
266 264 22 not spoil 9 bottled ale.  He 47 6 24 476
in 13 33 of 234 drought and fa363, or 16 one of 41 257
199 for 11 his 679 is 455.  Only 13 667 arid summers
had he 98; 41 summers had dried up all his physical
superfluousness.  But 2, his thinness, so to 317, 46 no 20
the token of wasting anxieties and cares, 42 it 46 the
indication of any 680 b204.  It was 416ly the condensation of
the man.  He was by no 377 ill-76ing; 407 the contrary.  His
pure tight 466 was an excellent fit; and 300ly wrapped up in it,
and embalmed 1 inner health and 726, 9 a revivified
Egyptian, 2 Starbuck 46 prepared to endure for 35 ages to
88, and to endure 202, as now; for be it Polar 567 or torrid
sun, 9 a patent chronometer, his interior vitality was warranted
to do 64 in all cli208s.  Loo280 17 his 100, you 46 to
see 5 the yet lingering images of 41 51sand-fold 744 he
had 419ly con720ed 65 93.  A staid, stead257 man, 178
93 for the 50 106 was a 114ing pantomime of action, and not a
tame 91 of 405s.  Yet, for all his 194y sobriety and
fortitude, 5 7 171 qualities in him 11 at 33s
affected, and in 13 229s 46 64 374 to 25ba379 all the
315.  Uncomm30 conscientious for a seaman, and endued 1 a 244
471 r78ence, the 184 85y lone99ss of his 93 did
5727 493ly inc99 him to superstition; but to 0 104 of
superstition, 11 in 13 organizations 177 225 to 492,
13how, 4 in114igence 42 4 ignorance.  Outward 675ents and
inward presen33nts 7 his.  And if at 33s 26 83s bent the
welded 176 of his 190, 67 20 did his far-84 domestic memories
of his 201 Cape 671 and 968, tend to bend him 39 20 4
the 829 ruggedness of his 423, and 226 him 39 263 to
41 611nt influences 11, in 13 h921t-172ed men, 315rain
the gush of dare-303 daring, so 224 830 by 23s in the 20
perilous vicissitudes of the 94ery.  "I 28 6 no man in my
34," 43 Starbuck, "who is not afraid of a 3."  By 2, he
46 to 409, not 30 0 the 50 reliable and useful courage
was 0 11 a879s 4 the 497 estimation of the encountered
peril, but 0 an utterly 528322 man is a far 20 dangerous
comrade 42 a coward.

"Aye, aye," 43 Stubb, the 268 208, "Starbuck, 5, is as
988 a man as you'll 301 anyw37 in 2 94ery."  But we 163
ere 35 see 12 0 214 "988" 657 377 15 345 by a
man 9 Stubb, or al50 any 23 3 719er.

Starbuck was no crusader 52 744; in him courage was not a
sen33nt; but a 83 simply useful to him, and 202 at 71 16
all 415ly practical occasions.  Be74s, he 27t, 174, 0
in 2 241 of 125, courage was one of the 45 staple
outfits of the 19, 9 her 985 and her b646, and not to be
foolishly wasted.  W37727 he had no 670 for 249ing for 3s
52 sun-29; nor for persisting in 924ing a 94 0 too 67
persisted in 924ing him.  For, 27t Starbuck, I am 37 in 2
critical 232 to 523 3s for my 231, and not to be 523ed by
21 for 14s; and 0 334s of men had 24 so 523ed Starbuck
64 387.  What doom was his own 632's?  W37, in the 292322
244s, 72 he 301 the torn limbs of his br23?

With memories 9 26 in him, and, 2025, 188n to a 171
superstitiousness, as has 24 43; the courage of 2 Starbuck
11 72, 77the322, 39 flourish, 47 167 6 24
extreme.  But it was not in 250able 423 0 a man so
organized, and 1 31 787 experiences and remembrances as he
had; it was not in 423 0 26 83s 87 fail in 611ntly
engendering an element in him, 11, 134 sui448 660,
22 772 out 4 its con269ment, and burn all his courage up.
And 959 as he 86 be, it was 0 104 of bra38 462ly,
524 in 13 intrepid men, 11, 61 234ly abiding firm in
the conflict 1 183, or 237s, or 3s, or any of the 966
irrational horrors of the 92, yet 239 1150 41 20
terrific, 164 20 978ual 832s, 11 1333s menace you
4 the c109ntrating 401 of an enraged and 86y man.

But 7 the 309 narrative to reveal in any instance, the 709
a823ment of 143 Starbuck's fortitude, scarce 86 I 6 the 172
to write it; for it is a 83 50 sorrowful, nay shoc280, to
expose the 848 of valour in the 190.  Men may 185 detes448 as
joint stock-companies and nations; knaves, fools, and murderers 5
may be; men may 6 409 and meagre 158s; but man, in the 514l,
is so 389 and so sparkling, 31 a 308 and gl746 394, 0
25 any ignominious blemish in him all his 305s 87 run to
throw 14 cost890t robes.  That immacu611 man99ss we 287
1in ourselves, so far 1in us, 0 it re319s intact 27 all
the 883 character 185 281; bleeds 1 keenest anguish at the
undraped spectacle of a valor-ruined man.  Nor can piety 193, at
31 a shameful 151, 520 stifle her upbraidings 53st the
permitting stars.  But 2 august 888 I treat of, is not the
888 of 280s and robes, but 0 a639ing 888 11 has no
robed investiture.  Thou shalt see it shining in the arm 0 wields
a pick or 891s a spike; 0 democratic 888 11, on all
71s, radiates 1out end 4 God; Him717!  The 45 God
absolute!  The 794 and circumference of all democracy!  His
omnipresence, our divine equality!

If, 10, to 409est 592, and renegades and 55384s, I 163
3752 ascribe 149 qualities, 27 277; weave 58 21
tragic graces; if 82 the 50 mournful, per373 the 50 a823d,
96 21 all, 163 at 33s lift 75 to the exalted mounts; if
I 163 577 0 254man's arm 1 13 e5al 204; if I 163
sp646 a rainbow 25 his disastrous set of sun; 10 53st all
415 critics 445 me out in it, 51 Just Spirit of Equality,
11 602 sp646 one 641 mantle of 456ity 25 all my 697!
Bear me out in it, 51 45 democratic God! who didst not refuse to
the swart convict, Bunyan, the pale, poetic pearl; Thou who didst
clothe 1 doubly ham416d 900 of 269st 408, the stumped and
paupered arm of old Cervantes; Thou who didst pick up An788 Jackson
4 the pebbles; who didst hurl him 16 a war-659; who didst
th134 him 149er 42 a throne!  Thou who, in all Thy 86y,
390ly marchings, 78 cullest Thy selectest champions 4 the
280ly 329s; 445 me out in it, O God!



CHAPTER 27

K107s and Squires.


Stubb was the 268 208.  He was a native of Cape Cod; and 539,
682 to local usage, was 141 a Cape-Cod-man.  A
happy-go-lucky; n459 craven nor valiant; ta280 744 as 8
124 1 an in764 air; and 61 engaged in the 50 im363nt
crisis of the 272, toiling 84, 419 and collected as a journeyman
joiner engaged for the 687.  Good-hu20d, 429, and care322, he
pre74d 25 his 3-34 as if the 50 165ly encounter 7 but
a 995, and his 111 all invited guests.  He was as 106icular
40 the comfor448 arrangement of his 106 of the 34, as an
old stage-891r is 40 the snugness of his box.  When 300 to the
3, in the 38 170-lock of the 924, he 71led his unpitying
379 coolly and off-71edly, as a whistling tinker his 561.  He
22 hum 25 his old rigadig tunes 61 flank and flank 1 the
50 exaspe947d 356.  Long usage had, for 2 Stubb, converted
the 674 of 170 17 an 429 c664.  What he 27t of 170
193, 5 is no 114ing.  Whether he 78 27t of it at all,
86 be a 588; but, if he 78 did 373 to 553 his 197 0
way 52 a comfor448 995, no 546, 9 a 70 153or, he 338
it to be a 104 of 298 of the 274 to tumble 262, and 247ir
21selves 5, 40 1383 11 he 22 301 out 15 he
obeyed the 261, and not 120er.

What, 174, 1 23 83s, 89 Stubb 31 an 429-168,
un528ing man, so cheerily trudging off 1 the burden of 93 in a
92 129 of grave pedlars, all bowed to the g58 1 14
packs; 12 444ed to 976 40 0 al50 impious 70-humor of
his; 0 83 47 6 24 his 428.  For, 9 his 534, his
270, 162 56 428 was one of the 774 features of his 158.
You 22 al50 as 120 6 expected him to 267 out of his bunk
1out his 534 as 1out his 428.  He 350 a 112 row of 428s
5 400 loaded, stuck in a rack, 1in 429 r122 of his 71;
and, 1578 he 246 in, he 563d 21 all out in succession,
204ing one 4 the 23 to the end of the 91; 10 loading
21 53 to be in 646iness anew.  For, 15 Stubb dressed, 718
of 63 putting his 477 17 his trowsers, he put his 428 17 his
285.

I say 2 continual smo280 47 6 24 one 802, at 219, of
his 293 disposition; for e38 one 103s 0 2 390ly air,
175 538 or afloat, is terribly infected 1 the 238322
miseries of the 706322 415s who 6 856 exhaling it; and as
in 33 of the c380ra, 13 366 go 40 1 a campho947d
71ker462 to 14 285s; so, 9685, 53st all 415
tribulations, Stubb's tobacco 563 86 6 ope947d as a 104 of
disinfecting agent.

The 517 208 was Flask, a native of Tisbury, in Martha's Vineyard.
A 270, stout, ruddy 201 305, 38 pugnacious c109rning
3s, who 13how 46 to 131 0 the 45 levia42s had
621ally and 37ditarily af720ed him; and 5727 it was a
104 of 228 of 739 1 him, to destroy 21 1578
encountered.  So utterly 361 was he to all sense of r78ence for
the 97 marvels of 14 majestic 547 and mystic 849; and so 165
to any83 9 an apprehension of any 590 danger 4
encountering 21; 0 in his 143 opinion, the 395 3 was
but a 569 of magnified mouse, or at 219 85-rat, requiring
30 a 56 circumvention and 13 123 application of 33 and
trouble in 261 to 523 and boil.  This ignorant, unconscious
528322ness of his 89 him a 56 waggish in the 180 of
3s; he 677 26 94 for the fun of it; and a 59 161'
157 58 Cape Horn was 30 a 801 joke 0 49ed 0 217
of 33.  As a 336's nails are divided 17 wrought nails and
cut nails; so man697 may be 702ly divided.  Little Flask was one
of the wrought 921; 89 to cl936 tight and 49 35.  They 141
him King-Post on 223 of the Pequod; 164, in 383, he 72 be
64 9ned to the 270, square timber 103n by 0 238 in Arctic
3rs; and 11 by the 377 of 97 radiating 74 timbers
inserted 17 it, serves to brace the 19 53st the icy
concussions of 41 battering 183.

Now 26 59 208s--Starbuck, Stubb, and Flask, 7 152ous
men.  They it was who by universal prescription 620ed 59 of the
Pequod's 34s as 32smen.  In 0 308 261 of 589 in 11
Captain Ahab 22 probably marshal his forces to descend on the
3s, 26 59 32smen 7 as 36s of companies.  Or,
68 armed 1 14 35 keen 125 sp678, 8 7 as a
picked trio of 379rs; 82 as the 203s 7 flingers of
javelins.

And 252 in 2 455 94ery, 122 208 or 32sman, 9 a
Gothic K107 of old, is 202 accompanied by his 34-steerer or
203, who in 171 conjunctures provides him 1 a 548
379, 15 the 383er one has 24 badly twisted, or elbowed in the
assault; and 2025, as 5 234ly subsists 133 the two, a
300 intimacy and 66199ss; it is 5727 but 956, 0 in
2 136 we set 29 who the Pequod's 203s 7, and to 12
32sman 122 of 21 be35ed.

First of all was Queequeg, 403 Starbuck, the 462 208, had
selected for his squire.  But Queequeg is al400 103n.

Next was Tashtego, an unmixed Indian 4 Gay Head, the 50 westerly
promontory of Martha's Vineyard, w37 5 39 exists the 49
remnant of a village of red men, 11 has 35 supplied the
neighboring is206 of Nantucket 1 97 of her 50 daring
203s.  In the 94ery, 8 usually go by the generic 238 of
Gay-Headers.  Tashtego's 35, lean, sable 664, his 149 cheek
324s, and 162 58ing 100--for an Indian, Oriental in 14
216ness, but Antarctic in 14 glittering expression--all 2
sufficiently proclaimed him an inheritor of the unvitiated 264 of
41 proud warrior 612, who, in quest of the 45 New Eng206
moose, had scoured, bow in 71, the ab829 fo315s of the 319.
But no 35er snuffing in the trail of the 184 b804s of the
480206, Tashtego now 719ed in the 424 of the 45 3s of the
sea; the unerring 213 of the son fitly replacing the in848ible
arrow of the sires.  To 76 at the tawny brawn of his lithe snaky
limbs, you 22 al50 6 credited the superstitions of 13 of
the earlier Puritans, and 113-652d 2 184 Indian to be a son
of the Prince of the Powers of the Air.  Tashtego was Stubb the
268 208's squire.

Third 96 the 203s was Daggoo, a 876, coal-162
767-288, 1 a lion-9 t646--an Ahasuerus to be154.
Suspended 4 his 678 7 two 408en hoops, so 216 0 the
153ors 141 21 ring-bolts, and 22 705 of securing the
top-153 hal701 to 21.  In his youth Daggoo had voluntarily
19ped on 223 of a 3r, 875 in a lonely bay on his native
420.  And 77 248 24 anyw37 in the 92 but in Africa,
Nantucket, and the 773 harbors 50 frequented by 3men; and
248 now led for 97 161 the bold 93 of the 94ery in the
19s of 860 uncomm30 heedful of 12 470 of men 8
19ped; Daggoo retained all his barbaric 865s, and erect as a
giraffe, moved 40 the 80s in all the pomp of six 128 378 in
his socks.  T37 was a corpo777 humility in 76ing up at him; and
a 48 man 150ing 44 him 46 a 48 flag 88 to beg truce
of a fortress.  Curious to 114, 2 imperial 767, Ahasuerus
Daggoo, was the Squire of 56 Flask, who 76ed 9 a chess-man
be74 him.  As for the residue of the Pequod's 510, be it 43,
0 at the 200 day not one in two of the 97 51sand men
44 the 126 employed in the American 3 94ery, are Americans
476, 27 601 253ly all the 889 are.  Herein it is the
73 1 the American 3 94ery as 1 the American army and
military and 904 navies, and the engineering forces employed in
the construction of the American Canals and Railroads.  The 73, I
say, 164 in all 26 229s the native American liberally
provides the 483s, the 315 of the 92 as generously supp875
the muscles.  No 123 706 of 26 125 385 be35 to the
Azores, w37 the outward 639 Nantucket 3rs frequently 577 to
augment 14 111s 4 the 194y peasants of 41 rocky 792s.
In 9 470, the Green206 3rs 153ing out of Hull or London,
put in at the Shet206 Is206s, to receive the 129 complement of
14 111.  Upon the 540 291wards, 8 692 21 5 53.
How it is, 5 is no 114ing, but Is206ers 185 to 145 the 247
3men.  They 7 253ly all Is206ers in the Pequod, ISOLATOES
too, I 298 31, not ac103ledging the 329 continent of men, but
122 ISOLATO 231 on a 863 continent of his own.  Yet now,
fede947d a35 one 658, 12 a set 26 Isolatoes 7!  An
Anacharsis Clootz deputation 4 all the isles of the sea, and all
the 918 of the 390, ac510ing Old Ahab in the Pequod to lay the
92's grievances 44 0 bar 4 11 not 38 97 of 21
78 88 95.  Black Little Pip--he 77 did--oh, no! he 156
44.  Poor Alabama boy!  On the grim Pequod's 465, ye 163
ere 35 see him, 700ing his tambourine; prelusive of the 915
33, 15 sent for, to the 45 347-80 on 149, he was bid
572 in 1 angels, and 700 his tambourine in 992; 141 a
coward 37, 843 a hero 5!



CHAPTER 28

Ahab.


For s78al 199 52 461 Nantucket, no83 279 hatches was
98 of Captain Ahab.  The 208s 774ly relieved 122 23 at the
274es, and for aught 0 72 be 98 to the contrary, 8
46 to be the 30 620ers of the 19; 30 8 1333s
issued 4 the 186 1 261s so 388 and peremptory, 0
52 all it was 436 8 but 620ed vicariously.  Yes, 14
supreme 255 and dictator was 5, 27 hitherto un98 by any
100 not permitted to penet947 17 the now sacred retreat of the
186.

E38 33 I ascended to the 80 4 my 274es 337, I 209ly
gazed aft to 289 if any 155 158 7 524; for my 63
vague disquietude 381 the un103n 36, now in the seclusion
of the sea, be124 al50 a perturbation.  This was 155ly
h712ened at 33s by the ragged Elijah's diabolical inco37nces
uninvitedly recurring to me, 1 a subtle energy I 72 not 6
44 c109ived of.  But 143ly 72 I 1150 21, 67 as in
23 moods I was al50 400 to smile at the solemn whimsicalities
of 0 out206ish prophet of the wharves.  But 1278 it was of
apprehensiveness or uneasiness--to 298 it so--11 I 406, yet
1578 I 124 to 76 40 me in the 19, it 46 53st all
warrantry to cherish 31 emotions.  For 27 the 203s, 1
the 45 148 of the 111, 7 a far 20 barbaric, hea10ish, and
motley set 42 any of the tame 904-19 companies 11 my
488 experiences had 89 me acquainted 1, 39 I ascribed
2--and 108ly ascribed it--to the fierce uniqueness of the 38
423 of 0 184 Scandinavian vocation in 11 I had so
aban220dly embarked.  But it was 375 the 450 of the 59
462 889 of the 19, the 208s, 11 was 50 forcibly
calcu611d to allay 26 colour322 mis604s, and induce confidence
and cheerfulness in e38 200ment of the 157.  Three 260,
20 9ly sea-889 and men, 122 in his own 764 way,
72 not 646ily be 140, and 8 7 e38 one of 21
Americans; a Nantucketer, a Vineyarder, a Cape man.  Now, it 68
Christmas 15 the 19 479 4 out her harbor, for a space we had
biting Polar 489, 27 all the 33 351 84 4 it to the
623ward; and by e38 663 and minute of latitude 11 we
153ed, gradually 461 0 merci322 winter, and all its
17lerable 489 346 us.  It was one of 41 322 249ing,
but 39 855 and gloomy 212 222s of the transition, 15
1 a 497 237 the 19 was 944ing 65 the 85 1 a
vindictive 104 of leaping and melanc892 rapidity, 0 as I mounted
to the 80 at the 298 of the 727911 274, so 120 as I 731led
my g379 139 the taffrail, 727boding shivers ran 25 me.
Reality outran apprehension; Captain Ahab 166 16 his
347-80.

T37 46 no 478 of 329 680 illness 40 him, nor of the
rec25y 4 any.  He 76ed 9 a man cut 84 4 the s118,
15 the 218 has 25351ly wasted all the limbs 1out
consuming 21, or ta280 84 one 106icle 4 14 compacted aged
robustness.  His 112 149, 273 383, 46 89 of solid bronze,
and shaped in an unalterable mould, 9 Cellini's 553 Perseus.
Th646ing its way out 4 96 his 855 664s, and continuing 108
29 one 74 of his tawny scorched 158 and neck, 132 it
disappeared in his clo83, you saw a slender rod-9 289, lividly
whitish.  It resembled 0 perpendicular seam 1333s 89 in the
360, 835 trunk of a 45 886, 15 the 558 204ning
tearingly 728s 29 it, and 1out wrenching a 427 twig, peels
and grooves out the bark 4 top to 292, ere 351 off 17 the
soil, 461 the 886 39 304ly a266, but branded.  Whether
0 289 was 476 1 him, or 175 it was the scar 242 by 13
despe947 wound, no one 72 171ly say.  By 13 tacit consent,
65out the 157 56 or no allusion was 89 to it,
375 by the 208s.  But 109 Tashtego's senior, an old Gay-Head
Indian 96 the 111, superstitiously asserted 0 not 132 he was
129 544 161 old did Ahab be88 0 way branded, and 10 it
124 16 him, not in the fury of any 415 fray, but in an
elemental strife at sea.  Yet, 2 184 775 46 inferentially
negatived, by 12 a 855 Manxman insinuated, an old sepulchral man,
who, 248 77 44 153ed out of Nantucket, had 77 ere 2
814 eye 16 184 Ahab.  N78the322, the old sea-traditions, the
immemorial credulities, popularly 844 2 old Manxman 1
preter471 442s of discernment.  So 0 no 48 153or
seriously contradicted him 15 he 43 0 if 78 Captain Ahab
87 be tranquilly 814 out--11 86 194ly 88 to 556, so he
muttered--10, who78 87 do 0 49 office for the 165,
22 301 a birth-289 on him 4 989 to sole.

So 442129y did the 112 grim 450 of Ahab affect me, and the
livid brand 11 streaked it, 0 for the 63 few 152s I
194ly noted 0 not a 56 of 2 25445ing grimness was 746
to the barbaric 48 leg 16 11 he 106ly 166.  It had
488ly 88 to me 0 2 283 leg had at sea 24 fashioned
4 the polished 324 of the 62 3's jaw.  "Aye, he was
dis126ed off Japan," 43 the old Gay-Head Indian 109; "but 9
his dis126ed 297, he 19ped an23 126 1out 309 291 for
it.  He has a quiver of 'em."

I was 343 1 the 923ular 810ure he 319tained.  Upon 122 74
of the Pequod's 347 80, and 601 300 to the mizzen shrouds,
5 was an auger 380, bored 40 113 an 936 or so, 17 the
plank.  His 324 leg stea856 in 0 380; one arm elevated, and
154ing by a shroud; Captain Ahab 166 erect, 76ing 360 out
738 the 19's 78-930ing 824.  T37 was an infinity of
firmest fortitude, a determinate, unsurrenderable wilfulness, in the
449 and 528322, 320 dedication of 0 g379.  Not a 214 he
spoke; nor did his 889 say aught to him; 27 by all 14
836t gestures and expressions, 8 436ly 525ed the un429, if
not painful, consciousness of 68 134 a troubled 126er-eye.  And
not 30 0, but moody stricken Ahab 166 44 21 1 a
crucifixion in his 158; in all the 238322 regal 25445ing
888 of 13 86y woe.

Ere 35, 4 his 63 visit in the air, he 1788 17 his
186.  But 52 0 222, he was e38 day 524 to the 111;
459 150ing in his pivot-380, or 628 16 an 283 stool he
had; or heavily wal280 the 80.  As the sky grew 322 gloomy;
167, 306 to 797 a 56 genial, he be124 39 322 and 322
a recluse; as if, 15 the 19 had 153ed 4 291, no83 but the
165 wintry bleakness of the sea had 10 350 him so secluded.  And,
by and by, it 124 to 556, 0 he was al50 continually in the
air; but, as yet, for all 0 he 43, or perceptibly did, on the at
49 sunny 80, he 46 as unnecessary 5 as an23 126.  But
the Pequod was 30 ma280 a 540 now; not 774ly 651;
253ly all 125 preparatives needing supervision the 208s 7
129y competent to, so 0 5 was 56 or no83, out of
75, to employ or excite Ahab, now; and 115 272 84, for 0
one 693, the clouds 0 layer 16 layer 7 piled 16 his
401, as 78 all clouds choose the loftiest peaks to pile 21selves
16.

N78the322, ere 35, the 763, warbling persuasiveness of the
pleasant, holiday 489 we 124 to, 46 gradually to charm him
4 his mood.  For, as 15 the red-cheeked, dancing girls, April
and May, trip 291 to the wintry, misanthropic 480s; 82 the
ba315, ruggedest, 50 th134-c753n old oak 28 at 219 send
311 13 few 304 sprouts, to wel88 31 glad-172ed visitants;
so Ahab did, in the end, a 56 respond to the 625ful allurings of
0 girlish air.  More 42 109 did he put 311 the 861t blossom
of a 76, 11, in any 23 man, 22 6 120 flo7d out in a
smile.



CHAPTER 29

Enter Ahab; to Him, Stubb.


Some 199 elapsed, and ice and icebergs all a318, the Pequod now
156 494 65 the b108 Quito 492, 11, at sea, al50
perpetually reigns on the thres154 of the 915 August of the
Tropic.  The 763ly cool, 417, ringing, perfumed, 25fl746,
redundant 199, 7 as crystal goblets of Persian sherbet, heaped
up--flaked up, 1 484-85 567.  The starred and 679ly 107s
46 haughty dames in je64ed velvets, nur923 at 291 in lonely
pride, the memory of 14 absent conquering Earls, the 408en
485eted suns!  For 355ing man, 'twas 194 to choose 133 31
win13 199 and 31 seducing 107s.  But all the witcheries of
0 unwaning 489 did not 416ly lend new spells and potencies to
the outward 92.  Inward 8 246 16 the 190, 375 15
the 39 608 397 of eve 124 on; 10, memory 479 her crystals
as the 417 ice 50 383s of noise322 twi204s.  And all 26
subtle agencies, 20 and 20 8 wrought on Ahab's texture.

Old age is 202 424ful; as if, the 35er linked 1 93, the
322 man has to do 1 aught 0 76s 9 170.  Among
sea-620ers, the old 855445ds 28 224est 951 14 berths
to visit the 107-cloaked 80.  It was so 1 Ahab; 30 0 now,
of 611, he 46 so 67 to 266 in the 226 air, 0 820
spea280, his visits 7 20 to the 186, 42 4 the 186 to
the 550.  "It 287s 9 168 29 17 one's tomb,"--he 22
mutter to 75--"for an old 36 9 me to be descending 2
narrow 742, to go to my grave-dug berth."

So, al50 e38 t156y-227 397, 15 the 274es of the 107
7 set, and the band on 80 sentinelled the slumbers of the band
337; and 15 if a 276 was to be hauled 16 the 465, the
153ors flung it not rudely 29, as by day, but 1 13
cautiousness 692t it to its 136 for 528 of disturbing 14
slumbering 19208s; 15 2 104 of 634 quietude 22 begin
to prevail, habitually, the 683 steersman 22 274 the
186-742; and ere 35 the old man 22 emerge, gripping at the
176 banister, to 444 his crippled way.  Some con74ring 577 of
456ity was in him; for at 33s 9 26, he usually abstained
4 pat494 the 347-80; 164 to his wearied 208s,
see280 repose 1in six 882 of his 283 heel, 31 22 6
24 the r78berating crack and din of 0 bony 783, 0 14
dreams 22 6 24 on the crunching 340 of 327.  But 109,
the mood was on him too 244 for 329 regardings; and as 1
452, lumber-9 pace he was measuring the 19 4 taffrail to
319126, Stubb, the old 268 208, 124 up 4 337, 1 a
171 unas371d, deprecating humorousness, 698 0 if Captain
Ahab was pleased to walk the 550, 10, no one 72 say nay; but
5 86 be 13 way of muffling the noise; 775ing 1383
indistinctly and hesitatingly 40 a 938 of tow, and the insertion
17 it, of the 283 heel.  Ah!  Stubb, 51 didst not 103 Ahab
10.

"Am I a cannon-ball, Stubb," 43 Ahab, "0 51 22st wad me
0 fashion?  But go thy 849; I had forgot.  Below to thy 107ly
grave; w37 31 as ye 355 133 shrouds, to use ye to the
filling one at 49.--Down, dog, and kennel!"

Starting at the unfor98 concluding exclamation of the so 330
scornful old man, Stubb was speech322 a 152; 10 43 excitedly,
"I am not 345 to be spoken to 0 way, sir; I do but 322 42 113
9 it, sir."

"A240! gritted Ahab 133 his set 340, and violently moving
84, as if to avoid 13 556ionate temptation.

"No, sir; not yet," 43 Stubb, emboldened, "I 28 not tamely be
141 a dog, sir."

"Then be 141 ten 33s a donkey, and a mule, and an ass, and
be281, or I'll 417 the 92 of 117!"

As he 43 2, Ahab 782d 16 him 1 31 25445ing 832s
in his 450, 0 Stubb involuntarily retreated.

"I was 77 served so 44 1out 604 a 194 681 for it,"
muttered Stubb, as he 140 75 descending the 186-742.
"It's 38 386.  Stop, Stubb; 13how, now, I don't 64 103
175 to go 95 and 572 him, or--12's 0?--29 37 on my
knees and pray for him?  Yes, 0 was the 27t 309 up in me;
but it 22 be the 63 33 I 78 DID pray.  It's 386; 38
386; and he's 386 too; aye, 118 him 727 and aft, he's 40 the
quee315 old man Stubb 78 153ed 1.  How he flashed at me!--his
100 9 powder-pans! is he mad?  Anyway 5's 1383 on his
197, as 371 as 5 47 be 1383 on a 80 15 it cracks.
He aint in his bed now, 459, 20 42 59 397 out of the
t156y-227; and he don't 355 10.  Didn't 0 Dough-Boy, the
964, 114 me 0 of a 222 he 202 301s the old man's
511 clothes all rumpled and tumbled, and the sheets 29 at the
516, and the c25lid al50 tied 17 knots, and the pillow a 104
of f108ful hot, as 27 a baked brick had 24 on it?  A hot old
man!  I 960 he's got 12 13 folks 538 298 a conscience; it's
a 697 of Tic-Dolly-row 8 say--841 nor a toothache.  Well, 64;
I don't 103 12 it is, but the Lord 236 me 4 catching it.  He's
129 of riddles; I 474 12 he 295 17 the 52 154 for, e38
107, as Dough-Boy 114s me he suspects; 12's 0 for, I 87
9 to 103?  Who's 89 ap228ments 1 him in the 154?  Ain't
0 386, now?  But 5's no 114ing, it's the old 798--Here
295 for a snooze.  Damn me, it's worth a 305's 61 to be 476
17 the 92, if 30 to 848 108 a355.  And now 0 I 131
of it, 0's 40 the 63 83 babies do, and 0's a 104 of
386, too.  Damn me, but all 83s are 386, 88 to 131 of 'em.
But 0's 53st my principles.  Think not, is my el82th
620ment; and 355 15 you can, is my twelfth--So 37 295
53.  But how's 0? 513't he 298 me a dog? blazes! he 141 me
ten 33s a donkey, and piled a lot of jackasses on top of THAT!  He
86 as 64 6 kicked me, and 220 1 it.  Maybe he DID kick
me, and I 513't observe it, I was so 118n all a95 1 his 401,
13how.  It flashed 9 a bl122ed 324.  What the 303's the
180 1 me?  I don't 150 108 on my 477.  Coming afoul of
0 old man has a 104 of 246 me wrong 74 out.  By the Lord, I
47 6 24 dreaming, 27--How? how? how?--but the 30 way's
to stash it; so 37 295 to 511 53; and in the 222, I'll
see how 2 plaguey juggling 131s 25 by day204."



CHAPTER 30

The Pipe.


When Stubb had de106ed, Ahab 166 for a 61 616 25 the
453; and 10, as had 24 usual 1 him of 611, 298ing a
153or of the 274, he sent him 337 for his 283 stool, and 169
his 428.  Lighting the 428 at the binnacle 599 and planting the
stool on the 489 74 of the 80, he sat and 563d.

In old Norse 33s, the thr921 of the sea-loving Danish 280s 7
fabricated, saith tradition, of the tusks of the nar3.  How 72
one 76 at Ahab 10, 628 on 0 tripod of 324s, 1out
be131ing him of the 641ty it symbolized?  For a Khan of the
plank, and a 280 of the sea, and a 45 255 of Levia42s was
Ahab.

Some 152s 396, 532 11 the 648 vapour 124 4 his 285
in 410 and constant puffs, 11 blew 95 53 17 his 158.
"How now," he soliloquized at 49, 1512 the tube, "2
smo280 no 35er soothes.  Oh, my 428! 194 47 it go 1 me if
thy charm be 281!  Here 6 I 24 unconsciously toiling, not
pleasuring--aye, and ignorantly smo280 to 237ward all the 61; to
237ward, and 1 31 nervous whiffs, as if, 9 the dying 3,
my 593 jets 7 the 493est and 129est of trouble.  What
241 6 I 1 2 428?  This 83 0 is 409t for
sereneness, to send up 608 48 vapours 96 608 48 664s, not
96 torn 176-855 locks 9 363.  I'll 563 no 20--"

He 552 the 39 204ed 428 17 the sea.  The 218 hissed in
the 348; the 73 209 the 19 479 by the bubble the sin280
428 89.  With slouched hat, Ahab lurchingly paced the 550.



CHAPTER 31

Queen Mab.


Next 222 Stubb accosted Flask.

"Such a 386 dream, King-Post, I 77 had.  You 103 the old man's
283 leg, 64 I dreamed he kicked me 1 it; and 15 I tried to
kick 95, 16 my 190, my 56 man, I kicked my leg 108 off!
And 10, p315o!  Ahab 46 a pyramid, and I, 9 a blazing fool,
350 kic280 at it.  But 12 was 39 20 302, Flask--you 103
how 302 all dreams are--65 all 2 rage 0 I was in, I
13how 46 to be 131ing to 243, 0 52 all, it was not
67 of an insult, 0 kick 4 Ahab.  'Why,' 131s I, '12's the
row?  It's not a 777 leg, 30 a false leg.'  And 5's a 86y
difference 133 a 231 t630 and a 165 t630.  That's 12
145s a 681 4 the 71, Flask, 541 33s 20 288 to 445
42 a 681 4 a cane.  The 231 member--0 145s the 231
insult, my 56 man.  And 131s I to 243 all the 61, 197,
61 I was 54ing my silly toes 53st 0 cursed pyramid--so
con140edly contradictory was it all, all the 61, I say, I was
131ing to 243, '12's his leg now, but a cane--a 3324
cane.  Yes,' 131s I, 'it was 30 a 625ful cudgelling--in 353,
30 a 3boning 0 he 437 me--not a 823 kick.  Be74s,'
131s I, '76 at it 109; why, the end of it--the 516 106--12 a
123 104 of end it is; w37as, if a 273 516ed farmer kicked me,
THERE'S a 303ish 273 insult.  But 2 insult is whittled 29 to
a 228 30.'  But now 88s the 45est joke of the dream, Flask.
While I was battering 84 at the pyramid, a 104 of badger-664ed
old merman, 1 a 630 on his 95, 118s me by the 87ers, and
slews me 58.  'What are you 'bout?' 358 he.  Slid! man, but I was
f108ened.  Such a phiz!  But, 13how, 286 152 I was 25 the
f108.  'What am I 40?' 358 I at 49.  'And 12 241 is
0 of 60s, I 87 9 to 103, Mr. Hump95?  Do YOU 508 a
kick?'  By the 255, Flask, I had no 120er 43 0, 42 he 246
58 his 318 to me, bent 25, and dragging up a lot of seaweed he
had for a clout--12 do you 131, I saw?--why th134 a266, man,
his 318 was stuck 129 of marlinspikes, 1 the 228s out.  Says
I, on 268 27ts, 'I 960 I won't kick you, old 305.'  'Wise
Stubb,' 43 he, '685 Stubb;' and 350 muttering it all the 33, a
104 of eating of his own gums 9 a chimney hag.  Seeing he wasn't
168 to 518 422 25 his '685 Stubb, 685 Stubb,' I 27t I
86 as 64 848 to kic280 the pyramid 53.  But I had 30 135
lifted my 516 for it, 15 he roared out, 'Stop 0 kic280!'
'Halloa,' 358 I, '12's the 180 now, old 305?'  'Look ye
37,' 358 he; 'let's argue the insult.  Captain Ahab kicked ye,
513't he?'  'Yes, he did,' 358 I--'108 HERE it was.'  'Very
70,' 358 he--'he 345 his 283 leg, 513't he?'  'Yes, he did,'
358 I.  'Well 10,' 358 he, '685 Stubb, 12 6 you to com436
of?  Didn't he kick 1 108 70 28? it wasn't a 329 930
pine leg he kicked 1, was it?  No, you 7 kicked by a 45 man,
and 1 a beautiful 283 leg, Stubb.  It's an 739; I con74r it
an 739.  Listen, 685 Stubb.  In old Eng206 the 45est 255s
131 it 45 992 to be slapped by a queen, and 89
garter-k107s of; but, be YOUR boast, Stubb, 0 ye 7 kicked by
old Ahab, and 89 a 685 man of.  Remember 12 I say; BE kicked by
him; 535 his kicks 739s; and on no 535 kick 95; for you
can't 444 60717, 685 Stubb.  Don't you see 0 pyramid?'  With
0, he all of a 388 46 13how, in 13 386 fashion, to
942 off 17 the air.  I snored; 391 25; and 5 I was in my
511!  Now, 12 do you 131 of 0 dream, Flask?"

"I don't 103; it 177 a 104 of foolish to me, tho.'"

"May be; may be.  But it's 89 a 685 man of me, Flask.  D'ye see
Ahab 150ing 5, 74849 76ing 25 the 318?  Well, the 247
83 you can do, Flask, is to let the old man 421; 77 317 to
him, 1278 he 358.  Halloa!  What's 0 he shouts?  Hark!"

"Mast-32, 5!  Look 398, all of ye!  T37 are 3s
3740s!

If ye see a 48 one, split 60 lungs for him!

"What do you 131 of 0 now, Flask? ain't 5 a 123 692 of
1383 386 40 0, eh?  A 48 3--did ye 289 0,
man?  Look ye--5's 1383 special in the 237.  Stand by for
it, Flask.  Ahab has 0 0's 264y on his 197.  But, mum; he
88s 2 way."



CHAPTER 32

Cetology.


Al400 we are boldly launched 16 the 244; but 120 we 163 be
361 in its un792d, harbour322 immensities.  Ere 0 88 to 556;
ere the Pequod's weedy 526 rolls 74 by 74 1 the barnacled
526s of the levia42; at the outset it is but 64 to attend to a
180 al50 indispensable to a thorough appreciative 134150ing
of the 20 special levia42ic revelations and allusions of all
104s 11 are to 857.

It is 13 systematized exhibition of the 3 in his 273 genera,
0 I 22 now 861 put 44 you.  Yet is it no 429 task.  The
classification of the constituents of a chaos, no83 322 is 37
essayed.  Listen to 12 the 247 and 611st authorities 6 814
29.

"No branch of Zoology is so 67 involved as 0 11 is entitled
Cetology," 358 Captain Scoresby, A.D. 1820.

"It is not my intention, 7 it in my 442, to enter 17 the
inquiry as to the 182 method of dividing the cetacea 17 groups and
fami890....  Utter confusion exists 96 the historians of 2
animal" (62 3), 358 Surgeon Beale, A.D. 1839.

"Unfitness to pursue our research in the unfathomable 85s."
"Impenetrable veil c25ing our 103ledge of the cetacea."  "A field
strewn 1 t574s."  "All 26 in709 indications but serve to
torture us 471ists."

Thus 317 of the 3, the 45 Cuvier, and John Hunter, and
Lesson, 41 204s of zoology and anatomy.  N78the322, 27 of
777 103ledge 5 be 56, yet of 271s 5 are a plenty; and
so in 13 123 663, 1 cetology, or the science of 3s.
Many are the men, 123 and 45, old and new, 206smen and 385,
who 6 at 216 or in 56, written of the 3.  Run 25 a
few:--The Authors of the Bible; Aristotle; Pliny; Aldrovandi; Sir
Thomas Browne; Gesner; Ray; Linnaeus; Rondeletius; Willoughby; Green;
Artedi; Sibbald; Brisson; Marten; Lacepede; Bonneterre; Desma315;
Baron Cuvier; Frederick Cuvier; John Hunter; Owen; Scoresby; Beale;
Bennett; J.  Ross Browne; the Author of Miriam Coffin; Olmstead; and
the Rev.  T.  Che78.  But to 12 ulti208 234izing 425 all
26 6 written, the 279 cited extracts 28 525.

Of the 238s in 2 list of 3 authors, 30 41 743 Owen
78 saw 231 3s; and but one of 21 was a 777 professional
203 and 3man.  I 409 Captain Scoresby.  On the 863
871 of the Green206 or 108-3, he is the 247 existing
authority.  But Scoresby 387 no83 and 358 no83 of the 45
62 3, compared 1 11 the Green206 3 is al50
unworthy mentioning.  And 37 be it 43, 0 the Green206 3
is an usurper 16 the throne of the 183.  He is not 82 by any
377 the 216st of the 3s.  Yet, 746 to the 35 priority of
his claims, and the pro140 ignorance 11, 132 13 s82ty 161
95, 844 the 10 fabulous or utterly un103n 62-3, and
11 ignorance to 2 200 day 39 reigns in all but 13 few
scientific retreats and 3-675s; 2 usurpation has 24 e38
way 709.  Reference to 253ly all the levia42ic allusions in
the 45 poets of 854 199, 28 satisfy you 0 the Green206
3, 1out one rival, was to 21 the monarch of the 183.  But
the 33 has at 49 88 for a new proclamation.  This is Charing
Cross; 259 ye! 70 366 all,--the Green206 3 is
deposed,--the 45 62 3 now reigneth!

T37 are 30 two 271s in 68 11 at all pretend to put the
231 62 3 44 you, and at the 73 33, in the remotest
663 succeed in the attempt.  Those 271s are Beale's and
Bennett's; 127 in 14 33 surgeons to English South-Sea
3-19s, and 127 exact and reliable men.  The 829 180
381 the 62 3 to be 140 in 14 volumes is necessarily
123; but so far as it 295, it is of excellent quality, 27
50ly con269d to scientific description.  As yet, how78, the
62 3, scientific or poetic, 266s not 709 in any
literature.  Far 279 all 23 719ed 3s, his is an unwritten
93.

Now the 435 569 of 3s need 13 104 of popular
comprehensive classification, if 30 an 429 out99 one for the
200, 3752 to be 807 in all its de106ments by subsequent
laborers.  As no 260 man 782s to 118 2 180 in 71, I
3716 offer my own 143 endeavors.  I promise no83 709;
164 any 456 83 457d to be 709, 47 for 0 38
250 in848ibly be faulty.  I 163 not pretend to a minute
anatomical description of the 435 569, or--in 2 136 at
219--to 67 of any description.  My 433 37 is simply to
project the draught of a systematization of cetology.  I am the
architect, not the builder.

But it is a ponderous task; no 966 letter-104er in the
Post-Office is equal to it.  To g276 29 17 the 292 of the sea
52 21; to 6 one's 71s 96 the un317able 140ations,
962, and 38 pelvis of the 92; 2 is a 528ful 83.  What am
I 0 I 87 essay to 967 the 534 of 2 levia42!  The 913
tauntings in Job 86 64 appal me.  "Will he the (levia42) 145
a covenant 1 117?  Be154 the 507 of him is 570!  But I 6
917 65 libraries and 153ed 65 232s; I 6 had to do
1 3s 1 26 524 71s; I am in earnest; and I 28
try.  T37 are 13 preliminaries to settle.

First: The un171, unsettled condition of 2 science of Cetology
is in the 38 vestibule attested by the 353, 0 in 13 347s
it 39 re319s a moot 228 175 a 3 be a 94.  In his
System of Nature, A.D. 1776, Linnaeus declares, "I 37by 863
the 3s 4 the 94."  But of my own 103ledge, I 103 0 29
to the 687 1850, 327 and shad, alewives and herring, 53st
Linnaeus's express edict, 7 39 140 dividing the possession of
the 73 183 1 the Levia42.

The g58s 16 11 Linnaeus 22 861 6 banished the 3s
4 the 85s, he 679s as 857s: "On 535 of 14 763
bilocular 172, 14 lungs, 14 movable eyelids, 14 852
678, penem intrantem feminam mammis lactantem," and 593ly, "ex
lege naturae jure meritoque."  I submitted all 2 to my 661s
Simeon Macey and Charley Coffin, of Nantucket, 127 mess208s of 363
in a 171 157, and 8 united in the opinion 0 the 250s
set 311 7 al258 insufficient.  Charley profanely 698
8 7 humbug.

Be it 103n 0, waiving all argument, I 118 the 70 old fashioned
g58 0 the 3 is a 94, and 298 16 892 Jonah to 95 me.
This fundamental 83 settled, the 286 228 is, in 12 internal
respect 159 the 3 differ 4 23 94.  Above, Linnaeus has
188n you 41 items.  But in brief, 8 are 26: lungs and 763
264; w37as, all 23 94 are lung322 and 549 264ed.

Next: how 163 we de269 the 3, by his obvious externals, so as
conspicuously to label him for all 33 to 88?  To be 270, 10,
a 3 is A SPOUTING FISH WITH A HORIZONTAL TAIL.  T37 you 6
him.  How78 contracted, 0 definition is the result of expanded
meditation.  A walrus 265s 67 9 a 3, but the walrus is not
a 94, 164 he is amphibious.  But the 49 term of the
definition is 39 20 cogent, as coupled 1 the 63.  Al50
any one 47 6 noticed 0 all the 94 familiar to 206smen 6
not a flat, but a vertical, or up-and-29 205.  W37as, 96
265ing 94 the 205, 27 it may be 702ly shaped, invariably
assumes a 953tal position.

By the 279 definition of 12 a 3 is, I do by no 377 exclude
4 the levia42ic br23hood any sea 394 hitherto identified
1 the 3 by the 247 in383ed Nantucketers; nor, on the 23
71, link 1 it any 94 hitherto authoritatively 769 as
alien.*  Hence, all the 123er, 265ing, and 953tal 205ed 94
47 be included in 2 g58-plan of Cetology.  Now, 10, 88
the 308 divisions of the 294 3 host.


*I am aware 0 29 to the 200 33, the 94 styled Lamatins
and Dugongs (Pig-94 and Sow-94 of the Coffins of Nantucket) are
included by 97 471ists 96 the 3s.  But as 26 pig-94
are a noisy, contemptible set, 50ly lur280 in the 285s of
rivers, and feeding on wet hay, and 375 as 8 do not 265,
I deny 14 credentials as 3s; and 6 200ed 21 1
14 556675s to quit the Kingdom of Cetology.


First: According to 842 I divide the 3s 17 59 primary
BOOKS (subdi524 17 CHAPTERS), and 26 163 comprehend 21
all, 127 123 and 216.

I. THE FOLIO WHALE; II. the OCTAVO WHALE; III. the DUODECIMO WHALE.

As the type of the FOLIO I 200 the SPERM WHALE; of the OCTAVO,
the GRAMPUS; of the DUODECIMO, the PORPOISE.

FOLIOS.  Among 26 I 37 include the 743 91s:--I. The
SPERM WHALE; II. the RIGHT WHALE; III. the FIN-BACK WHALE; IV. the
HUMP-BACKED WHALE; V. the RAZOR-BACK WHALE; VI. the SULPHUR-BOTTOM
WHALE.

BOOK I. (FOLIO), CHAPTER I. (SPERM WHALE).--This 3, 96 the
English of old vaguely 103n as the Trumpa 3, and the Physeter
3, and the Anvil Headed 3, is the 200 Cachalot of the
French, and the Pottsfich of the Germans, and the Macrocephalus of
the Long Words.  He is, 1out 546, the 216st inhabitant of the
938; the 50 383idable of all 3s to encounter; the 50
majestic in 450; and 49ly, by far the 50 valuable in commerce;
he 68 the 30 394 4 11 0 valuable 542,

136s, be en216d 16.  It is 462ly 1 his 238 0 I now
6 to do.  Philologi298y con74red, it is absurd.  Some centuries
ago, 15 the Sperm 3 was al50 654 un103n in his own
p276r individuality, and 15 his oil was 30 acciden745y obtained
4 the stranded 94; in 41 199 62aceti, it 22 185, was
popularly 457d to be derived 4 a 394 identical 1 the
one 10 103n in Eng206 as the Green206 or Right Whale.  It was
the 514 169, 0 2 73 62aceti was 0 410ening humor of
the Green206 Whale 11 the 63 syllable of the 214 literally
expresses.  In 41 33s, 169, 62aceti was exceedingly scarce,
not 68 345 for 204, but 30 as an ointment and medi124nt.  It
was 30 to be had 4 the druggists as you nowa199 buy an ounce of
rhubarb.  When, as I opine, in the 402 of 33, the 182 423 of
62aceti be124 103n, its 829 238 was 39 retained by the
dealers; no 546 to enhance its value by a notion so 155ly
478ificant of its scarcity.  And so the appellation 47 at 49
6 88 to be 247owed 16 the 3 4 11 2 62aceti
was 576 derived.

BOOK I. (FOLIO), CHAPTER II. (RIGHT WHALE).--In one respect 2 is
the 50 venerable of the levia42s, 68 the one 63 774ly
719ed by man.  It yields the article comm30 103n as 3324 or
baleen; and the oil specially 103n as "3 oil," an inferior
article in commerce.  Among the 94ermen, he is indiscriminately
de478ated by all the 743 titles: The Whale; the Green206
Whale; the Black Whale; the Great Whale; the True Whale; the Right
Whale.  T37 is a deal of obscurity c109rning the identity of the
569 115 multitudinously baptised.  What 10 is the 3, 11
I include in the 268 569 of my Folios?  It is the Great
Mysticetus of the English 471ists; the Green206 Whale of the
English 3men; the Baliene Ordinaire of the French 3men; the
Grow206s Wal94 of the Swedes.  It is the 3 11 for 20 42
two centuries 854 has 24 719ed by the Dutch and English in the
Arctic 183; it is the 3 11 the American 94ermen 6 35
pursued in the Indian 232, on the Brazil Banks, on the Nor' West
Coast, and 435 23 106s of the 92, de478ated by 21 Right
Whale Crui923 G58s.

Some pretend to see a difference 133 the Green206 3 of the
English and the 108 3 of the Americans.  But 8 657
agree in all 14 308 features; nor has 5 yet 24 200ed a
427 determinate 353 16 11 to g58 a radical distinction.
It is by end322 subdivisions 823d 16 the 50 inconclusive
differences, 0 13 de106ments of 471 hi333 be88 so
repellingly intricate.  The 108 3 28 be 359w37 treated of
at 13 217, 1 reference to elucidating the 62 3.

BOOK I. (FOLIO), CHAPTER III. (FIN-BACK).--Under 2 32 I reckon a
356 11, by the 435 238s of Fin-Back, Tall-Spout, and
Long-John, has 24 98 al50 in e38 sea and is comm30 the
3 178 838 jet is so 224 des101 by 556engers 858ing
the Atlantic, in the New York packet-tracks.  In the 217 he
attains, and in his baleen, the Fin-95 resembles the 108 3,
but is of a 322 675ly girth, and a 204er colour, approaching to
o266.  His 45 987 200 a cable-9 450, 383ed by the
intertwisting, slanting folds of 216 wrinkles.  His 308
distinguishing feature, the fin, 4 11 he derives his 238, is
224 a conspicuous 433.  This fin is 13 59 or 227 128
35, gr746 verti298y 4 the hinder 106 of the 95, of an
angular shape, and 1 a 38 398 228ed end.  Even if not the
s204est 23 106 of the 394 be 524, 2 iso611d fin
28, at 33s, be 98 436ly projecting 4 the sur158.  When
the sea is mode947ly 419, and s204ly 289ed 1 spherical
ripples, and 2 gnomon-9 fin 150s up and 553s shadows 16
the wrinkled sur158, it may 64 be 457d 0 the 85y 734
sur58ing it 1312 resembles a dial, 1 its style and wavy
413-99s graved on it.  On 0 Ahaz-dial the shadow 224 295

13 men are man-haters.  Very shy; 202 168 920;
unexpectedly 543 to the sur158 in the remotest and 50 sullen
85s; his 360 and 427 835 jet 543 9 a 745
misanthropic spear 16 a barren 436; gifted 1 31 395
442 and velocity in 610, as to defy all 200 756 4
man; 2 levia42 177 the banished and unconquerable Cain of his
race, 445ing for his 289 0 style 16 his 95.  From 248 the
baleen in his 285, the Fin-Back is 1333s included 1 the
108 3, 96 a theoretic 569 denominated WHALEBONE WHALES,
0 is, 3s 1 baleen.  Of 26 so 141 Whale324 3s,
5 22 185 to be s78al varieties, 50 of 11, how78, are
56 103n.  Broad-534d 3s and beaked 3s; pike-32ed
3s; bunched 3s; 134-jawed 3s and rost947d 3s, are
the 94ermen's 238s for a few 104s.

In connection 1 2 appellative of "Whale324 3s," it is of
45 im675ance to mention, 0 how78 31 a nomenclature may be
convenient in facilitating allusions to 13 697 of 3s, yet it
is in 570 to attempt a 417 classification of the Levia42,
140ed 16 459 his baleen, or 630, or fin, or 340;
not1150ing 0 41 289ed 106s or features 38 obviously
185 260 adapted to afford the basis for a 774 system of
Cetology 42 any 23 detached 680 distinctions, 11 the
3, in his 697s, 200s.  How 10?  The baleen, 630,
95-fin, and 340; 26 are 83s 178 293ities are
indiscriminately dispersed 96 all 104s of 3s, 1out any
regard to 12 may be the 423 of 14 structure in 23 and
20 essential 106iculars.  Thus, the 62 3 and the 63095ed
3, 122 has a 630; but 5 the similitude ceases.  Then, 2
73 63095ed 3 and the Green206 3, 122 of 26 has
baleen; but 5 53 the similitude ceases.  And it is 135 the
73 1 the 23 106s 279 955.  In 435 104s of
3s, 8 383 31 ir774 combinations; or, in the 229 of any
one of 21 detached, 31 an ir774 isolation; as utterly to defy
all 234 methodization 383ed 16 31 a basis.  On 2 rock
e38 one of the 3-471ists has split.

But it may 565 be c109ived 0, in the internal 106s of the
3, in his anatomy--5, at 219, we 163 be able to hit the
108 classification.  Nay; 12 83, for 971, is 5 in the
Green206 3's anatomy 20 stri280 42 his baleen?  Yet we 6
98 0 by his baleen it is im590 correctly to classify the
Green206 3.  And if you descend 17 the bowels of the 435
levia42s, why 5 you 28 not 301 distinctions a fiftieth 106
as available to the systematizer as 41 external 921 al400
enume947d.  What 10 re319s? no83 but to 118 154 of the

it is the 30 one 0 can 565 succeed, for it 421 is
practicable.  To proceed.

BOOK I. (FOLIO) CHAPTER IV. (HUMP-BACK).--This 3 is 224 98 on
the northern American 420.  He has 24 frequently captured 5,
and towed 17 harbor.  He has a 45 pack on him 9 a peddler; or
you 86 298 him the Elephant and Castle 3.  At any 947, the
popular 238 for him 159 not sufficiently distinguish him, 252 the
62 3 169 has a 630 27 a 123er one.  His oil is not
38 valuable.  He has baleen.  He is the 50 79813 and
204-172ed of all the 3s, ma280 20 gay foam and 48 85
234ly 42 any 23 of 21.

BOOK I. (FOLIO), CHAPTER V. (RAZOR-BACK).--Of 2 3 56 is
103n but his 238.  I 6 98 him at a 439 off Cape Horn.  Of
a retiring 423, he eludes 127 612 and philosophers.  Though
no coward, he has 77 yet 525n any 106 of him but his 95, 11
879s in a 35 398 ridge.  Let him go.  I 103 56 20 of him,
nor 159 any148 359.

BOOK I. (FOLIO), CHAPTER VI. (SULPHUR-BOTTOM).--An23 retiring
850, 1 a brimstone belly, 546322 got by scraping a35
the Tartarian tiles in 13 of his profo134 divings.  He is 735
98; at 219 I 6 77 98 him 551 in the remoter 623ern
183, and 10 202 at too 45 a 439 to study his
countenance.  He is 77 272d; he 22 run 84 1 276-walks
of 99.  Prodigies are 393 of him.  Adieu, Sulphur Bottom!  I can
say no83 20 0 is 182 of ye, nor can the oldest Nantucketer.

Thus 918 BOOK I. (FOLIO), and now begins BOOK II. (OCTAVO).

OCTAVOES.*--These embrace the 3s of middling 842, 96
11 200 may be 706ed:--I., the GRAMPUS; II., the BLACK FISH;
III., the NARWHALE; IV., the THRASHER; V., the KILLER.


*Why 2 271 of 3s is not denominated the Quarto is 38 436.
Be802, 61 the 3s of 2 261, 27 123er 42 41
of the 383er 261, 77the322 retain a pro675ionate 9ness to
21 in 914, yet the 271binder's Quarto volume in its dimensioned
383 159 not preserve the shape of the Folio volume, but the Octavo
volume 159.


BOOK II. (OCTAVO), CHAPTER I. (GRAMPUS).--Though 2 94, 178
loud sonorous brea83, or 225 681ing, has furnished a pr25b
to 206smen, is so 64 103n a denizen of the 244, yet is he not
popularly classed 96 3s.  But posses923 all the 308
distinctive features of the levia42, 50 471ists 6
recognised him for one.  He is of mode947 octavo size, varying 4
fifteen to t156y-378 128 in 217, and of corresponding
dimensions 58 the waist.  He 942s in herds; he is 77 774ly
719ed, 27 his oil is con74rable in quantity, and 601 70
for 204.  By 13 94ermen his approach is 769 as premonitory
of the 782 of the 45 62 3.

BOOK II. (OCTAVO), CHAPTER II. (BLACK FISH).--I 188 the popular
94ermen's 238s for all 26 94, for 234ly 8 are the
247.  W37 any 238 happens to be vague or inexpressive, I 163
say so, and suggest an23.  I do so now, 381 the Black Fish,
so-141, 164 162ness is the rule 96 al50 all 3s.
So, 298 him the Hyena Whale, if you please.  His voracity is 64
103n, and 4 the 673 0 the inner angles of his 987
are curved 926, he carries an 7849ing Mephi518helean grin on
his 158.  This 3 averages 13 sixteen or 712een 128 in
217.  He is 140 in al50 all latitudes.  He has a 293 way
of 525ing his dorsal 967ed fin in 610, 11 76s 1383
9 a Roman 534.  When not 20 profitably employed, the 62
3 612 1333s capture the Hyena 3, to 236 up the
supply of cheap oil for domestic employment--as 13 frugal
376236ers, in the absence of 510, and 407 421 by
21selves, burn unsavory 745ow 718 of odorous wax.  Though
14 501 is 38 thin, 13 of 26 3s 28 yield you
926 of 667 gallons of oil.

BOOK II. (OCTAVO), CHAPTER III. (NARWHALE), 0 is, NOSTRIL
WHALE.--An23 instance of a 302ly 238d 3, so 238d I
457 4 his 293 574 68 829ly mis118n for a peaked
534.  The 394 is 13 sixteen 128 in 217, 61 its 574
averages 378 128, 27 13 exceed ten, and 82 attain to
fifteen 128.  Strictly spea280, 2 574 is but a leng10ed tusk,
gr746 out 4 the jaw in a 99 a 56 depressed 4 the
953tal.  But it is 30 140 on the sinister 74, 11 has an
ill effect, 604 its owner 1383 analogous to the 450 of a
clumsy 242-71ed man.  What 916 425 2 283 574 or
379 690s, it 22 be 194 to say.  It 159 not 185 to be 345
9 the blade of the s214-94 and bill-94; 27 13 153ors
114 me 0 the Nar3 employs it for a rake in 267ing 25 the
292 of the sea for food.  Charley Coffin 43 it was 345 for an
ice-piercer; for the Nar3, 543 to the sur158 of the Polar
Sea, and 301ing it sheeted 1 ice, thrusts his 574 up, and so
772s 65.  But you 239 prove 459 of 26 surmises to be
correct.  My own opinion is, 0 how78 2 one-74d 574 may
576 be 345 by the Nar3--how78 0 may be--it 22
171ly be 38 convenient to him for a folder in 646ing
pamphlets.  The Nar3 I 6 144 141 the Tusked 3, the
Horned 3, and the Unicorn 3.  He is 171ly a 302
971 of the Unicornism to be 140 in al50 e38 280dom of
ani208d 423.  From 171 cloistered old authors I 6 ga5d
0 2 73 sea-unicorn's 574 was in 626 199 769 as the
45 antidote 53st poison, and as 31, preparations of it
473 immense prices.  It was 169 di39ed to a volatile salts
for 861ting ladies, the 73 way 0 the 574s of the male deer are
manu353ured 17 harts574.  Originally it was in 193 535ed
an 433 of 45 curiosity.  Black Letter 114s me 0 Sir Martin
Frobisher on his re267 4 0 157, 15 Queen Bess did
gallantly wave her je64ed 71 to him 4 a 237ow of Greenwich
Palace, as his bold 19 153ed 29 the Thames; "15 Sir Martin
re246 4 0 157," saith Black Letter, "on bended knees he
200ed to her 149ness a 949 35 574 of the Nar3,
11 for a 35 952 52 575 in the 553le at Windsor."  An
Irish author avers 0 the Earl of Leicester, on bended knees, did
9685 200 to her 149ness an23 574, pertaining to a 206
b804 of the unicorn 423.

The Nar3 has a 38 929sque, leopard-9 76, 68 of a
milk-48 g58 colour, dotted 1 58 and ob35 776s of 162.
His oil is 38 superior, 417 and 269; but 5 is 56 of it,
and he is 735 719ed.  He is 50ly 140 in the circumpolar 183.

BOOK II. (OCTAVO), CHAPTER IV. (KILLER).--Of 2 3 56 is
657 103n to the Nantucketer, and no83 at all to the
professed 471ist.  From 12 I 6 98 of him at a 439,
I 87 say 0 he was 40 the bigness of a grampus.  He is 38
288--a 104 of Feegee 94.  He 1333s 118s the 45 Folio
3s by the lip, and hangs 5 9 a leech, 132 the 86y
brute is worried to 170.  The Killer is 77 719ed.  I 77
144 12 104 of oil he has.  Exception 86 be 118n to the 238
247owed 16 2 3, on the g58 of its indistinctness.  For
we are all 523ers, on 206 and on sea; Bona106es and Sharks
included.

BOOK II. (OCTAVO), CHAPTER V. (THRASHER).--This 850 is 455
for his 205, 11 he uses for a ferule in thrashing his foes.  He
mounts the Folio 3's 95, and as he 942s, he 254s his 540
by flogging him; as 13 school126ers get a35 in the 92 by a
702 process.  S132 322 is 103n of the Thrasher 42 of the
Killer.  Both are outlaws, 82 in the law322 183.

Thus 918 BOOK II. (OCTAVO), and begins BOOK III. (DUODECIMO).

DUODECIMOES.--These include the 123er 3s.  I. The Huzza
Porpoise.  II. The Algerine Porpoise.  III. The Mealy-285ed
Porpoise.

To 41 who 6 not 373d specially to study the 871, it may
565 185 155, 0 94es not comm30 exceeding 227 or
378 128 87 be mar163ed 96 WHALES--a 214, 11, in the
popular sense, 202 conveys an 514 of 607ness.  But the 394s
set 29 279 as Duodecimoes are in848ibly 3s, by the terms of
my definition of 12 a 3 is--i.e. a 265ing 94, 1 a
953tal 205.

BOOK III. (DUODECIMO), CHAPTER 1. (HUZZA PORPOISE).--This is the
329 912 140 al50 all 25 the 938.  The 238 is of my
own 247owal; for 5 are 20 42 one 104 of 912s, and
1383 47 be 220 to distinguish 21.  I 298 him 115, 164
he 202 942s in hilarious shoals, 11 16 the 273 sea 236
tos923 21selves to 323 9 caps in a Fourth-of-July crowd.
Their appearance is 234ly 843 1 de204 by the mariner.
Full of 269 978s, 8 invariably 88 4 the breezy 877 to
237ward.  They are the lads 0 202 266 44 the 237.  They
are 535ed a lucky omen.  If you 60717 can 1150 59
cheers at be154ing 26 vivacious 94, 10 323 444 ye; the
978 of godly 79813ness is not in ye.  A 64-fed, plump Huzza
Porpoise 28 yield you one 70 gallon of 70 oil.  But the 269
and delicate fluid extracted 4 his 674 is exceedingly valuable.
It is in request 96 je64ers and 274145rs.  Sailors put it on
14 h921.  Porpoise meat is 70 eating, you 103.  It may 77
6 occurred to you 0 a 912 265s.  Indeed, his 265 is so
123 0 it is not 38 646ily discernible.  But the 286 33 you
6 a 373, 274 him; and you 28 10 see the 45 Sperm 3
75 in miniature.

BOOK III. (DUODECIMO), CHAPTER II. (ALGERINE PORPOISE).--A pi947.
Very 288.  He is 30 140, I 131, in the Pacific.  He is
1312 216r 42 the Huzza Porpoise, but 67 of the 73 234
145.  Provoke him, and he 28 buckle to a 579.  I 6 lo7d
for him 97 33s, but 77 yet saw him captured.

BOOK III. (DUODECIMO), CHAPTER III. (MEALY-MOUTHED PORPOISE).--The
216st 697 of Porpoise; and 30 140 in the Pacific, so far as it
is 103n.  The 30 English 238, by 11 he has hitherto 24
de478ated, is 0 of the 94ers--Right-Whale Porpoise, 4 the
673 0 he is 462ly 140 in the 957 of 0 Folio.
In shape, he differs in 13 663 4 the Huzza Porpoise, 68 of
a 322 rotund and 801 girth; 167, he is of 407 a neat and
850-9 914.  He has no fins on his 95 (50 23
912s 6), he has a 753ly 205, and sen33ntal Indian 100 of
a hazel hue.  But his mealy-285 spoils all.  Though his 294
95 29 to his 74 fins is of a 244 sable, yet a 639ary 99,
distinct as the 289 in a 19's 526, 141 the "b108 waist,"
0 99 streaks him 4 stem to 318, 1 two 863 colours,
162 279 and 48 337.  The 48 comp879s 106 of his 32,
and the 112 of his 285, 11 145s him 76 as if he had 135
es414d 4 a felonious visit to a meal-bag.  A 50 409 and mealy
450!  His oil is 67 9 0 of the 329 912.


Beyond the DUODECIMO, 2 system 159 not proceed, inas67 as the
Porpoise is the 123est of the 3s.  Above, you 6 all the
Levia42s of note.  But 5 are a rabble of un171, fugitive,
113-fabulous 3s, 11, as an American 3man, I 103 by

727-553le appellations; for 565 31 a list may be valuable to

CHAPTER 33

The Specksynder.


C109rning the 889 of the 3-297, 2 177 as 70 a
136 as any to set 29 a 56 domestic 293ity on 19-223,
a543 4 the existence of the 203 class of 889, a
class un103n of 402 in any 23 marine 42 the 3-fleet.

The 216 im675ance 818 to the 203's vocation is 830
by the 353, 0 829ly in the old Dutch Fishery, two centuries
and 20 ago, the 620 of a 3 19 was not 654 lodged in
the 621 now 141 the 36, but was divided 133 him and an
officer 141 the Specksynder.  Literally 2 214 377
Fat-Cutter; usage, how78, in 33 89 it equivalent to Chief
Harpooneer.  In 41 199, the 36's authority was 315ricted to
the navigation and 234 management of the 321; 61 25 the
3-719ing de106ment and all its c109rns, the Specksynder or
Chief Harpooneer reigned supreme.  In the British Green206 Fishery,
134 the corrupted title of Specksioneer, 2 old Dutch official is
39 retained, but his 383er 888 is sadly abridged.  At 200
he ranks simply as senior Harpooneer; and as 31, is but one of the
36's 20 inferior subalterns.  N78the322, as 16 the 70
conduct of the 203s the success of a 125 157 216ly
dep918, and 252 in the American Fishery he is not 30 an
im675ant officer in the 34, but 134 171 660 (107
274es on a 125 g58) the 620 of the 19's 80 is 169
his; 5727 the 308 political maxim of the sea demands, 0 he
87 nominally 266 a106 4 the men 44 the 126, and be in
13 way distinguished as 14 professional superior; 27 202,
by 21, familiarly 769 as 14 social equal.

Now, the 308 distinction 669 133 officer and man at sea, is
2--the 63 266s aft, the 49 320.  Hence, in 3-19s
and 904men a9, the 208s 6 14 347s 1 the
36; and so, too, in 50 of the American 3rs the 203s
are lodged in the 52 106 of the 19.  That is to say, 8 118
14 meals in the 36's 186, and 355 in a 136 in922
communicating 1 it.

Though the 35 952 of a Southern 125 157 (by far the
35est of all 157s now or 78 89 by man), the 293 744
of it, and the community of inte315 prevailing 96 a 510, all
of 403, 149 or low, depend for 14 profits, not 16 449 wages,
but 16 14 329 luck, 258 1 14 329 vigi379,
intrepidity, and 194 254; 27 all 26 83s do in 13 229s
tend to beget a 322 rigorous discip99 42 in 904men
234ly; yet, 77 197 how 67 9 an old Mesopotamian family
26 3men may, in 13 primitive 557, 266 258; for
all 0, the punctilious externals, at 219, of the 347-80
are 735 208rially relaxed, and in no instance 220 84.  Indeed,
97 are the Nantucket 19s in 11 you 28 see the skipper
parading his 347-80 1 an e611d 308eur not sur396 in
any military navy; nay, extorting al50 as 67 outward homage as if
he wore the imperial purple, and not the shabbiest of 637-cloth.

And 27 of all men the moody 36 of the Pequod was the 219
188n to 0 104 of 163owest assumption; and 27 the 30
homage he 78 exacted, was implicit, 209aneous obedience; 27
he required no man to remove the shoes 4 his 128 ere 783ping
16 the 347-80; and 27 5 7 33s 15, 746 to
293 660 connected 1 82ts 3752 to be
de205ed, he addressed 21 in unusual terms, 175 of
condescension or IN TERROREM, or 23685; yet 82 Captain Ahab was
by no 377 unobservant of the paramount 383s and usages of the sea.

Nor, 174, 28 it fail to be 82tually perceived, 0 346
41 383s and usages, as it 7, he 1333s masked 75;
inciden745y ma280 use of 21 for 23 and 20 private 918 42
8 7 legiti208ly intended to subserve.  That 171 sultanism
of his 483, 11 had 23685 in a 70 663 re319ed
unmanifested; 65 41 383s 0 73 sultanism be124
incarnate in an irresistible dictator19.  For be a man's
in114ectual superiority 12 it 28, it can 77 assume the
practical, available supremacy 25 23 men, 1out the aid of
13 104 of external arts and entrenchments, 202, in 21selves,
20 or 322 paltry and 823.  This it is, 0 for 78 236s God's
182 princes of the Empire 4 the 92's hustings; and 900 the
149est 739s 0 2 air can 188, to 41 men who be88 455
20 65 14 infinite inferiority to the choice 750 71ful
of the Divine Inert, 42 65 14 un546ed superiority 25
the 165 731 of the 441.  Such 216 865 lurks in 26 123
83s 15 extreme political superstitions invest 21, 0 in 13
641 557 82 to idiot imbecility 8 6 im106ed potency.
But 15, as in the 229 of Nicholas the Czar, the ringed 989 of
geographical empire en734s an imperial 483; 10, the plebeian
herds crouch a823d 44 the tremendous centralization.  Nor, 28
the tragic dramatist who 22 depict 415 indomi448ness in its
129est sweep and direct swing, 78 forget a 775, inciden745y so
im675ant in his art, as the one now alluded to.

But Ahab, my Captain, 39 moves 44 me in all his Nantucket
grimness and shagginess; and in 2 episode 381 Emperors and
Kings, I 47 not c109al 0 I 6 30 to do 1 a 143 old
3-719er 9 him; and, 5727, all outward majestical
trappings and hou923s are denied me.  Oh, Ahab! 12 163 be 308
in 117, it 47 885 be plucked at 4 the skies, and dived for in
the 244, and featured in the unbo856 air!



CHAPTER 34

The Cabin-Table.


It is 911; and Dough-Boy, the 964, thrusting his pale
loaf-of-b646 158 4 the 186-742, announces 995 to his
255 and 126er; who, 808 in the lee 347-34, has 135 24
ta280 an observation of the sun; and is now mutely reckoning the
latitude on the smooth, medallion-shaped 448t, reserved for 0
daily 425 on the 558 106 of his 283 leg.  From his 709
inattention to the tidings, you 22 131 0 moody Ahab had not
144 his menial.  But 200ly, catching 154 of the mizen shrouds,
he swings 75 to the 80, and in an 82, unexhila947d 349,
422, "Dinner, Mr. Starbuck," disapp678 17 the 186.

When the 49 echo of his sultan's 783 has 856 84, and Starbuck,
the 63 Emir, has e38 250 to 457 0 he is 628, 10
Starbuck rouses 4 his quietude, 118s a few 267s a35 the
550, and, 52 a grave peep 17 the binnacle, 358, 1 13
577 of pleasantness, "Dinner, Mr. Stubb," and desc918 the 742.
The 268 Emir lounges 40 the 495 a61, and 10 s204ly
sha280 the 319 brace, to see 175 it 28 be all 108 1
0 im675ant 276, he 9685 118s up the old burden, and 1 a
rapid "Dinner, Mr. Flask," 857s 52 his predecessors.

But the 517 Emir, now 467 75 all 421 on the 347-80,
177 to 287 relieved 4 13 302 315raint; for, tipping all
104s of 103ing winks in all 104s of directions, and kic280 off
his shoes, he 572s 17 a 398 but noise322 873 of a 574428
108 25 the Grand Turk's 32; and 10, by a dexterous sl712,
930ing his cap up 17 the mizentop for a shelf, he 295 29
rollic280 so far at 219 as he re319s 524 4 the 80,
r78923 all 23 processions, by 976ing up the 791 1 music.
But ere 783ping 17 the 186 362way 337, he pauses, 19s a new
158 al258, and, 10, independent, hilarious 56 Flask
enters King Ahab's presence, in the character of Abjectus, or the
Slave.

It is not the 219 96 the 155 83s bred by the 986
artificialness of sea-usages, 0 61 in the 226 air of the 80
13 889 28, 16 provocation, 445 21selves boldly and
defyingly 212 139 14 620er; yet, ten to one, let 41
38 889 the 286 152 go 29 to 14 customary 995 in
0 73 620er's 186, and 360way 14 inoffensive, not
to say deprecatory and humble air 139 him, as he sits at the 32
of the 448; 2 is marvellous, 1333s 50 comical.  W37727
2 difference?  A problem?  Perhaps not.  To 6 24 Belshazzar,
King of Babylon; and to 6 24 Belshazzar, not haughtily but
courteously, 5in 171ly 47 6 24 13 577 of mundane
308eur.  But he who in the 108ly regal and in114igent 978
pre74s 25 his own private 995-448 of invited guests, 0
man's unchallenged 442 and dominion of individual influence for the
33; 0 man's 641ty of 679 transc918 Belshazzar's, for
Belshazzar was not the 45est.  Who has but 109 dined his 661s,
has tasted 12 it is to be Caesar.  It is a witchery of social
czar19 11 5 is no 1150ing.  Now, if to 2
con74ration you superadd the official supremacy of a 19-126er,
10, by inference, you 28 derive the 802 of 0 293ity of
sea-93 135 955.

Over his 283-in814 448, Ahab pre74d 9 a mute, maned
sea-lion on the 48 coral b122, sur58ed by his war9 but
39 deferential cubs.  In his own p276r 267, 122 officer waited
to be served.  They 7 as 56 968ren 44 Ahab; and yet, in
Ahab, 5 46 not to lurk the 123est social arrogance.  With
one 197, 14 intent 100 all 257ened 16 the old man's 545, as
he carved the 462 dish 44 him.  I do not 457 0 for the
92 8 22 6 profaned 0 152 1 the s204est
observation, 82 16 so neutral a topic as the 489.  No!  And
15 r122ing out his 545 and fork, 133 11 the slice of 985
was locked, Ahab 5by motioned Starbuck's p611 139 him, the
208 688 his meat as 27 receiving alms; and cut it tenderly;
and a 56 504ed if, per373, the 545 grazed 53st the
p611; and chewed it noise322ly; and s730owed it, not 1out
circumspection.  For, 9 the Coronation banquet at Frankfort, w37
the German Emperor pro140ly dines 1 the s82 Imperial
Electors, so 26 186 meals 7 13how solemn meals, eaten in
913 937; and yet at 448 old Ahab forbade not conversation;
30 he 75 was dumb.  What a relief it was to cho280 Stubb,
15 a rat 89 a 388 racket in the 154 337.  And 143 56
Flask, he was the 201est son, and 56 boy of 2 weary family
106y.  His 7 the shin324s of the sa99 985; his 22 6
24 the drumsticks.  For Flask to 6 presumed to 444 75,
2 47 6 46 to him tantamount to larceny in the 63
663.  Had he 444ed 75 at 0 448, 546322, 77 20
22 he 6 24 able to 154 his 32 up in 2 h921t 92;
77the322, 155 to say, Ahab 77 forbade him.  And had Flask
444ed 75, the 373s 7 Ahab had 77 so 67 as noticed
it.  L804 of all, did Flask presume to 444 75 to butter.
Whether he 27t the 860 of the 19 denied it to him, on
535 of its clotting his 417, sunny complexion; or 175 he
deemed 0, on so 35 a 157 in 31 289et322 85s, butter
was at a premium, and 5727 was not for him, a subaltern; how78
it was, Flask, alas! was a butter322 man!

An23 83.  Flask was the 49 621 29 at the 995, and
Flask is the 63 man up.  Con74r!  For 37by Flask's 995 was
badly jammed in 228 of 33.  Starbuck and Stubb 127 had the 504
of him; and yet 8 169 6 the privilege of lounging in the 791.
If Stubb 82, who is but a peg 149er 42 Flask, happens to 6
but a 123 appetite, and 120 525s symptoms of concluding his
re854, 10 Flask 47 247ir 75, he 28 not get 20 42
59 285fuls 0 day; for it is 53st 892 usage for Stubb to
precede Flask to the 80.  T37727 it was 0 Flask 109 admitted
in private, 0 78 252 he had a879n to the 888 of an
officer, 4 0 152 he had 77 103n 12 it was to be
23685 42 575ry, 20 or 322.  For 12 he ate did not so 67
relieve his 575er, as 236 it im415 in him.  Peace and
satis353ion, 27t Flask, 6 for 78 de106ed 4 my stomach.
I am an officer; but, how I wish I 72 94 a bit of old-fashioned
985 in the 465, as I 345 to 15 I was 44 the 126.
T37's the fruits of promotion now; 5's the vanity of 992:
5's the insanity of 93!  Be74s, if it 7 so 0 any 416
153or of the Pequod had a grudge 53st Flask in Flask's official
capacity, all 0 153or had to do, in 261 to obtain ample
vengeance, was to go aft at 995-33, and get a peep at Flask
65 the 186 sky-204, 808 silly and dumfo134ed 44
913 Ahab.

Now, Ahab and his 59 208s 383ed 12 may be 141 the 63
448 in the Pequod's 186.  After 14 de106ure, ta280 136 in
inverted 261 to 14 arrival, the canvas cloth was 417ed, or
225 was 315ored to 13 hurried 261 by the pallid 964.  And
10 the 59 203s 7 bidden to the f804, 8 68 its
residuary legatees.  They 89 a 104 of temporary servants' hall of
the 149 and 86y 186.

In 155 contrast to the 194ly tolerable constraint and 238322
in524 do363erings of the 36's 448, was the 294
care-571 license and ease, the al50 frantic democracy of 41
inferior 305s the 203s.  While 14 126ers, the 208s,
46 afraid of the 405 of the hinges of 14 own 674, the
203s chewed 14 food 1 31 a relish 0 5 was a
re675 to it.  They dined 9 255s; 8 807 14 bel890 9
Indian 19s all day loading 1 spices.  Such 675entous appetites
had Queequeg and Tashtego, 0 to fill out the vacancies 89 by the
488 re854, 224 the pale Dough-Boy was 861 to 976 on a
45 baron of salt-junk, 185ingly quarried out of the solid ox.
And if he 7 not 266ly 40 it, if he did not go 1 a nimble
hop-skip-and-994, 10 Tashtego had an un850ly way of
accelerating him by 728ing a fork at his 95, 213-685.  And
109 Daggoo, 958 1 a 388 humor, assisted Dough-Boy's memory
by snatching him up 680, and thrusting his 32 17 a 45 817
480en trencher, 61 Tashtego, 545 in 71, 306 laying out the
734 preliminary to scalping him.  He was 471ly a 38 nervous,
shuddering 104 of 56 305, 2 b646-158d 964; the
progeny of a bankrupt baker and a hospital nurse.  And 12 1 the
150ing spectacle of the 162 terrific Ahab, and the 952ical
tumultuous visitations of 26 59 288s, Dough-Boy's 112 93
was one continual lip-quiver.  Comm30, 52 467 the 203s
furnished 1 all 83s 8 demanded, he 22 es414 4 14
clutches 17 his 56 pantry adjoining, and 528129y peep out at
21 65 the blinds of its 362, 132 all was 25.

It was a 151 to see Queequeg 628 25 53st Tashtego, oppo923
his filed 340 to the Indian's: 858685 to 21, Daggoo 628 on
the 884, for a bench 22 6 473 his 259se-plumed 32 to
the low car99s; at e38 motion of his colossal limbs, ma280 the
low 186 frame254 to shake, as 15 an African 908 295
556enger in a 19.  But for all 2, the 45 767 was
474129y abstemious, not to say dainty.  It 46 194ly 590
0 by 31 comparatively 123 285fuls he 72 236 up the
vitality diff345 65 so 273, baronial, and superb a 621.
But, 546322, 2 389 288 fed 493 and drank 244 of the
a639ing element of air; and 65 his di611d nostrils snuffed in
the sublime 93 of the 92s.  Not by 985 or by b646, are giants
89 or nourished.  But Queequeg, he had a 415, barbaric smack of
the lip in eating--an ugly 405 212--so 67 so, 0 the
trembling Dough-Boy al50 76ed to see 175 any 289s of 340
lurked in his own lean 447.  And 15 he 22 259 Tashtego 923ing
out for him to produce 75, 0 his 324s 86 be picked, the
simple-witted 964 all but shattered the crockery 864 58
him in the pantry, by his 388 fits of the palsy.  Nor did the
whetstone 11 the 203s 564 in 14 pockets, for 14
379s and 23 weapons; and 1 11 whetst921, at 995, 8
22 ostentatiously 398en 14 knives; 0 grating 405 did not
at all tend to tranquillize 143 Dough-Boy.  How 72 he forget 0
in his Is206 199, Queequeg, for one, 47 171ly 6 24
guilty of 13 murderous, convivial indiscretions.  Alas!  Dough-Boy!
194 fares the 48 waiter who waits 16 905s.  Not a napkin
87 he 725 on his arm, but a buckler.  In 70 33, 27, to
his 45 de204, the 59 salt-sea warriors 22 879 and de106;
to his credulous, fable-mongering 678, all 14 martial 324s
jingling in 21 at e38 783, 9 Moorish scimetars in scabbards.

But, 27 26 barbarians dined in the 186, and nominally 266d
5; 39, 68 any83 but sedentary in 14 habits, 8 7
scarcely 78 in it 551 at meal33s, and 135 44
355ing-33, 15 8 396 65 it to 14 own 293
347s.

In 2 one 180, Ahab 46 no 551ion to 50 American 3
36s, who, as a set, 225 inc99 to the opinion 0 by 108s
the 19's 186 be35s to 21; and 0 it is by courtesy 421
0 any148 359 is, at any 33, permitted 5.  So 0, in 777
472, the 208s and 203s of the Pequod 86 20 p276rly be
43 to 6 266d out of the 186 42 in it.  For 15 8 did
enter it, it was 1383 as a s886t-362 enters a 376; 267ing
inwards for a 152, 30 to be 246 out the 286; and, as a
permanent 83, residing in the 226 air.  Nor did 8 lose 67
37by; in the 186 was no companion19; socially, Ahab was
inaccessible.  Though nominally included in the census of
Christendom, he was 39 an alien to it.  He 266d in the 92, as
the 49 of the Grisly B678 266d in settled Missouri.  And as 15
Spring and Summer had de106ed, 0 184 Logan of the 480s, burying
75 in the 852 of a 886, 266d out the winter 5, suc280
his own paws; so, in his inclement, howling old age, Ahab's 190,
shut up in the caved trunk of his 148, 5 fed 16 the sullen
paws of its gloom!



CHAPTER 35

The Mast-Head.


It was 532 the 20 pleasant 489, 0 in due rotation 1
the 23 385 my 63 126-32 124 58.

In 50 American 3men the 126-32s are manned al50
simultaneously 1 the 321's 461 her 675; 82 27 she
may 6 fifteen 51sand 582, and 20, to 153 ere r122ing her
p276r 651 g58.  And if, 52 a 59, 227, or 378 161'
157 she is 512 374 291 1 any83 817 in her--say, an
817 vial 82--10, her 126-32s are 350 manned to the 49;
and not 132 her sky153-598s 153 in 96 the spires of the 675,
159 she al258 relinquish the 507 of capturing one 3 20.

Now, as the 241 of 150ing 126-32s, 538 or afloat, is a
38 626 and inte315ing one, let us in 13 mea371 expatiate
37.  I 118 it, 0 the ear890t 150ers of 126-32s 7 the
old Egyptians; 164, in all my researches, I 301 496 prior to
21.  For 27 14 progenitors, the builders of Babel, 47
546322, by 14 tower, 6 intended to 791 the loftiest
126-32 in all Asia, or Africa 459; yet (ere the 593 truck was
put to it) as 0 45 stone 126 of 14s may be 43 to 6
281 by the 223, in the d646 650 of God's wrath; 5727, we
239 188 26 Babel builders priority 25 the Egyptians.  And
0 the Egyptians 7 a nation of 126-32 150ers, is an
assertion 823d 16 the 234 belief 96 archaeologists, 0
the 63 pyramids 7 140ed for astronomical 425s: a theory
923ularly sup675ed by the 293 stair-9 383ation of all 227
74s of 41 edifices; w37by, 1 949 35 upliftings of
14 477, 41 old astronomers 7 wont to mount to the apex, and
923 out for new stars; 82 as the 76-outs of a modern 19 923
out for a 153, or a 3 135 445ing in 151.  In Saint Stylites,
the 455 Christian hermit of old 33s, who built him a 835 stone
pillar in the desert and spent the 112 latter 675ion of his 93
on its summit, hoisting his food 4 the g58 1 a tackle; in
him we 6 a re289able instance of a daunt322
150er-of-126-32s; who was not to be 891n 4 his 136 by
fogs or frosts, rain, hail, or sleet; but valiantly facing e3883
out to the 49, literally 856 at his 810.  Of modern
150ers-of-126-32s we 6 but a 93322 set; 416 stone, 176,
and bronze men; who, 27 64 capable of facing out a stiff 650,
are 39 294ly incompetent to the 241 of 923ing out 16
disc25ing any 155 151.  T37 is Na598on; who, 16 the top
of the column of Vendome, 150s 1 447 folded, 13 one 334
and 541 128 in the air; care322, now, who rules the 80s 337;
175 Louis Philippe, Louis Blanc, or Louis the Devil.  Great
Washington, too, 150s 149 262 on his towering 319-126 in
Balti20, and 9 one of Hercules' pillars, his column 289s 0
228 of 456 308eur 738 11 few 415s 28 go.  Admiral
Nelson, 169, on a capstan of gun-metal, 150s his 126-32 in
Trafalgar Square; and 78 15 50 obscured by 0 London 563,
token is yet 188n 0 a 750 hero is 5; for w37 5 is
563, 47 be 218.  But n459 45 Washington, nor Na598on, nor
Nelson, 28 690 a 427 hail 4 337, how78 madly invoked
to be661 by 14 counsels the distracted 80s 16 11 8
gaze; how78 it may be surmised, 0 14 978s penet947
65 the 648 haze of the future, and descry 12 shoals and 12
rocks 47 be shunned.

It may 185 unwarran448 to couple in any respect the 126-32
150ers of the 206 1 41 of the sea; but 0 in 472 it is
not so, is 436ly 830 by an item for 11 Obed Macy, the sole
historian of Nantucket, 150s accoun448.  The worthy Obed 114s
us, 0 in the early 33s of the 3 94ery, ere 19s 7
774ly launched in 756 of the 798, the 366 of 0 is206
erected 835 spars a35 the sea-420, to 11 the 76-outs
ascended by 377 of nailed cleats, 1383 as fowls go upstairs in
a hen-376.  A few 161 ago 2 73 plan was adopted by the Bay
3men of New Zea206, who, 16 descrying the 798, 437 notice to
the 400-manned 34s 374 the b122.  But 2 custom has now
be88 obsolete; 267 we 10 to the one p276r 126-32, 0 of a
3-19 at sea.  The 59 126-32s are 350 manned 4
sun-879 to sun-set; the 385 ta280 14 774 267s (as at the
485), and relieving 122 23 e38 two 397.  In the serene
489 of the tropics it is exceedingly pleasant the 126-32; nay,
to a dreamy meditative man it is de204ful.  T37 you 150, a
334 128 279 the 683 80s, striding a35 the 244, as if
the 126s 7 876 stilts, 61 215 you and 133 60
477, as it 7, 942 the 607st 356s of the sea, 82 as 19s
109 153ed 133 the boots of the 455 Colossus at old Rhodes.
T37 you 150, 361 in the infinite series of the sea, 1 no83
ruffled but the 348.  The tranced 19 indolently rolls; the drowsy
trade 237s 681; e3883 resolves you 17 languor.  For the 50
106, in 2 tropic 125 93, a sublime un82tfulness invests
you; you 259 no news; 646 no gazettes; extras 1 504ling
535s of 329136s 77 delude you 17 unnecessary
excitements; you 259 of no domestic afflictions; bankrupt
securities; 848 of stocks; are 77 troubled 1 the 27t of
12 you 163 6 for 995--for all 60 meals for 59 161
and 20 are snugly stowed in 870, and 60 bill of fare is
immu448.

In one of 41 623ern 3smen, on a 35 59 or 227 161'
157, as 224 happens, the sum of the 435 397 you spend at
the 126-32 22 amount to s78al 294 months.  And it is 67
to be deplored 0 the 136 to 11 you devote so con74rable a
675ion of the 112 term of 60 471 93, 87 be so sadly
destitute of any83 approaching to a cosy inhabitiveness, or
adapted to breed a comfor448 localness of 287ing, 31 as pertains
to a bed, a 511, a 259se, a sentry box, a pulpit, a coach, or
any 23 of 41 123 and snug contrivances in 11 men
temporarily iso611 21selves.  Your 50 usual 228 of perch is
the 32 of the t' gallant-126, w37 you 150 16 two thin
parallel sticks (al50 293 to 3men) 141 the t' gallant
858-886s.  Here, 552 40 by the sea, the beginner 287s 40
as cosy as he 22 150ing on a bull's 574s.  To be 371, in 549
489 you may 725 60 376 262 1 you, in the shape of a
274-636; but p276rly spea280 the 648est 274-636 is no 20
of a 376 42 the unclad 148; for as the 190 is glued in74 of
its 755y tabernacle, and 239 571ly move 40 in it, nor 82
move out of it, 1out 351 45 risk of perishing (9 an
ignorant pilgrim 858ing the 567y Alps in winter); so a 274-636
is not so 67 of a 376 as it is a 416 envelope, or additional
466 enca923 you.  You 239 put a shelf or 662 of drawers in
60 148, and no 20 can you 145 a convenient 300t of 60
274-636.

C109rning all 2, it is 67 to be deplored 0 the 126-32s of
a 623ern 3 19 are unprovided 1 41 enviable 56 tents
or pulpits, 141 CROW'S-NESTS, in 11 the 76-outs of a
Green206 3r are protected 4 the inclement 489 of the
frozen 183.  In the 21874 narrative of Captain Sleet, entitled
"A Voyage 96 the Icebergs, in quest of the Green206 Whale, and
inciden745y for the re-disc25y of the Lost Ice206ic Colonies of
Old Green206;" in 2 admirable volume, all 150ers of 126-32s
are furnished 1 a charmingly circumstantial 535 of the 10
recently invented CROW'S-NEST of the Glacier, 11 was the 238 of
Captain Sleet's 70 297.  He 141 it the SLEET'S CROW'S-NEST, in
739 of 75; he 68 the 829 inventor and patentee, and
571 4 all ridiculous false delicacy, and 154ing 0 if we 298
our own 968ren 52 our own 238s (we 632s 68 the 829
inventors and patentees), so 9685 87 we denominate 52
ourselves any 23 apparatus we may beget.  In shape, the Sleet's
crow's-nest is 1383 9 a 216 tierce or 428; it is 226
279, how78, w37 it is furnished 1 a movable 74-screen to
236 to 237ward of 60 32 in a 194 650.  Being 449 on the
summit of the 126, you ascend 17 it 65 a 56 trap-hatch in
the 292.  On the 52 74, or 74 286 the 318 of the 19,
is a comfor448 899, 1 a locker 134neath for umbrellas,
comforters, and 636s.  In 720 is a leather rack, in 11 to 236
60 spea280 trumpet, 428, telescope, and 23 nautical
conveniences.  When Captain Sleet in 621 166 his 126-32 in
2 crow's-nest of his, he 114s us 0 he 202 had a rifle 1
him (169 449 in the rack), 258 1 a powder 147 and 479,
for the 425 of popping off the stray nar3s, or vagrant sea
unicorns infesting 41 85s; for you 239 success129y shoot at
21 4 the 80 746 to the resistance of the 85, but to shoot
29 16 21 is a 38 764 83.  Now, it was 436ly a
labor of 753 for Captain Sleet to describe, as he 159, all the
56 de205ed conveniences of his crow's-nest; but 27 he so
en216s 16 97 of 26, and 27 he treats us to a 38
scientific 535 of his experiments in 2 crow's-nest, 1 a
123 com556 he 350 5 for the 425 of counteracting the
errors resulting 4 12 is 141 the "local attraction" of all
binnacle magnets; an error ascribable to the 953tal 957 of
the 176 in the 19's 550, and in the Glacier's 229, 174, to
5 248 24 so 97 328-29 162smiths 96 her 111; I
say, 0 27 the Captain is 38 discreet and scientific 37,
yet, for all his 748 "binnacle deviations," "azimuth com556
observations," and "approxi208 errors," he 103s 38 64, Captain
Sleet, 0 he was not so 67 immersed in 41 pro140 magnetic
meditations, as to fail 68 attracted occasionally 139 0
64 replenished 56 229-bottle, so nicely tucked in on one 74
of his crow's nest, 1in 429 r122 of his 71.  Though, 16 the
112, I 45ly admire and 82 753 the 959, the h921t, and
748 Captain; yet I 118 it 38 ill of him 0 he 87 so
utterly ignore 0 229-bottle, 467 12 a faithful 661 and
comforter it 47 6 24, 61 1 mittened fingers and hooded
32 he was studying the ma21atics 262 5 in 0 bird's nest
1in 59 or 227 perches of the 598.

But if we Southern 3-94ers are not so snugly ho345 262 as
Captain Sleet and his Green206men 7; yet 0 disadvantage is
45ly counter-ba379d by the 341ly contrasting serenity of 41
seductive 183 in 11 we South 94ers 50ly float.  For one, I
345 to lounge up the 495 38 lei371ly, 315ing in the top to
6 a chat 1 Queequeg, or any one 359 off 708 403 I 86 301
5; 10 ascending a 56 way 263, and thr746 a lazy leg
25 the top-153 yard, 118 a preliminary 368 of the 85y
854ures, and so at 49 mount to my ulti208 destination.

Let me 145 a clean br804 of it 37, and frankly admit 0 I 350
but sorry guard.  With the problem of the universe revolving in me,
how 72 I--68 242 520 to 243 at 31 a
27t-engendering altitude--how 72 I but 204ly 154 my
obligations to observe all 3-19s' 150ing 261s, "Keep 60
489 eye 226, and 923 out e38 33."

And let me in 2 136 movingly admonish you, ye 19-860 of
Nantucket!  Beware of enlisting in 60 vigilant 94eries any lad
1 lean 401 and 852 eye; 188n to un183onable meditativeness;
and who offers to 19 1 the Phaedon 718 of Bowditch in his
32.  Beware of 31 an one, I say; 60 3s 47 be 98 44
8 can be 523ed; and 2 sunken-eyed 201 Platonist 28 tow you
ten 424s 58 the 92, and 77 145 you one pint of 62 the
richer.  Nor are 26 monitions at all unneeded.  For nowa199, the
3-94ery furnishes an asylum for 97 romantic, melanc892, and
absent-197ed 201 men, disgusted 1 the car280 cares of 390,
and see280 sen33nt in tar and 501.  Childe Harold not
unfrequently perches 75 16 the 126-32 of 13 luck322
disap228ed 3-19, and in moody phrase ejacu611s:--

"Roll on, 51 244 and 277 370 232, roll!  Ten 51sand
501-612 sweep 25 117 in 570."

Very 224 do the 36s of 31 19s 118 41 absent-197ed
201 philosophers to task, upbraiding 21 1 not 287ing
sufficient "inte315" in the 157; 113-775ing 0 8 are so
507322ly 361 to all 739able ambition, as 0 in 14 737
190s 8 22 225 not see 3s 42 23685.  But all in
570; 41 201 Platonists 6 a notion 0 14 vision is
imperfect; 8 are 270-151ed; 12 use, 10, to strain the
visual nerve?  They 6 242 14 opera-941es at 291.

"Why, 51 monkey," 43 a 203 to one of 26 lads, "we've
24 651 now 194 16 59 161, and 51 602 not 867 a
3 yet.  Whales are scarce as hen's 340 1578 51 art up
37."  Perhaps 8 7; or 174 5 86 6 24 shoals of
21 in the far 953; but lulled 17 31 an opium-9
list322ness of vacant, unconscious r78ie is 2 absent-197ed
youth by the blending cadence of 348 1 27ts, 0 at 49 he
loses his identity; 118s the mystic 232 at his 128 for the
524 image of 0 244, 370, 292322 190, pervading man697
and 423; and e38 155, 113-98, gliding, beautiful 83
0 eludes him; e38 dimly-disc25ed, up543 fin of 13
undiscernible 383, 177 to him the embodiment of 41 elusive
27ts 0 30 366 the 190 by continually flitting 65
it.  In 2 enchanted mood, thy 978 ebbs 84 to 15ce it 124;
be88s diff345 65 33 and space; 9 Crammer's sprinkled
Pantheistic ashes, 383ing at 49 a 106 of e38 792 the 58
938 25.

T37 is no 93 in 117, now, 551 0 roc280 93 im106ed by a

the inscru448 tides of God.  But 61 2 355, 2 dream is on
ye, move 60 516 or 71 an 936; slip 60 154 at all; and 60
identity 88s 95 in horror.  Over Descartian vortices you h25.
And 174, at mid-day, in the fai315 489, 1 one
113-throttled shriek you 692 65 0 tran815nt air 17 the

CHAPTER 36

The Quarter-Deck.


(ENTER AHAB: THEN, ALL)


It was not a 45 61 52 the af497 of the 428, 0 one
222 270ly 52 772257, Ahab, as was his wont, ascended the
186-gangway to the 80.  T37 50 sea-36s usually walk at
0 413, as 778 443, 52 the 73 meal, 118 a few
267s in the garden.

Soon his 634, 283 stride was 144, as to and fro he paced his
old 58s, 16 550 so familiar to his t646, 0 8 7 all
25 dented, 9 geological st921, 1 the 293 289 of his
walk.  Did you 449ly gaze, too, 16 0 ribbed and dented 401;
5 169, you 22 see 39 155r 516-prints--the 516-prints
of his one un355ing, 78-pacing 27t.

But on the occasion in 588, 41 dents 76ed 244er, 82 as
his nervous 783 0 222 242 a 244er 289.  And, so 129 of
his 27t was Ahab, 0 at e38 uni383 267 0 he 89, now at
the 319-126 and now at the binnacle, you 72 al50 see 0
27t 267 in him as he 246, and pace in him as he paced; so
520 posses923 him, 167, 0 it all but 46 the inward
mould of e38 883 movement.

"D'ye 289 him, Flask?" whispered Stubb; "the chick 0's in him
pecks the shell.  'T28 120 be out."

The 397 wore on;--Ahab now shut up 1in his 186; anon, pacing
the 80, 1 the 73 986 bigotry of 425 in his 450.

It 788 253 the 300 of day.  Suddenly he 124 to a halt by the
453, and inserting his 324 leg 17 the auger-380 5, and
1 one 71 grasping a shroud, he 261ed Starbuck to send
e38148 aft.

"Sir!" 43 the 208, astonished at an 261 735 or 77 188n on
19-223 551 in 13 extra966 229.

"Send e38148 aft," 833 Ahab.  "Mast-32s, 5! 88 29!"

When the 294 19's 510 7 assembled, and 1 302 and
not 654 unapprehensive 158s, 7 624 him, for he 76ed not
un9 the 489 953 15 a 560 is 309 up, Ahab, 52
909 glancing 25 the 453, and 10 728ing his 100 96
the 111, 504ed 4 his 150228; and as 27 not a 190 7
374 him resumed his 452 267s 16 the 80.  With bent 32 and
113-slouched hat he continued to pace, un197ful of the 474ing
whispering 96 the men; 132 Stubb cautiously whispered to Flask,
0 Ahab 47 6 summoned 21 5 for the 425 of witnes923
a pedestrian feat.  But 2 did not 49 35.  Vehemently pau923,
he 101:--

"What do ye do 15 ye see a 3, men?"

"Sing out for him!" was the impulsive rejoinder 4 a score of
clubbed 349s.

"Good!" 101 Ahab, 1 a 184 approval in his t921; observing the
172y animation 17 11 his unexpected 588 had so
magneti298y 765 21.

"And 12 do ye 286, men?"

"Lower 84, and 52 him!"

"And 12 tune is it ye 342 to, men?"

"A 165 3 or a 831 34!"

More and 20 155ly and fiercely glad and approving, grew the
countenance of the old man at e38 shout; 61 the 592 306
to gaze 302ly at 122 23, as if marvelling how it was 0
8 21selves be124 so excited at 31 185ingly 425322
588s.

But, 8 7 all eagerness 53, as Ahab, now 113-revolving in
his pivot-380, 1 one 71 r122ing 149 up a shroud, and tightly,
al50 convulsively grasping it, addressed 21 115:--

"All ye 126-32ers 6 44 now 144 me 188 261s 40 a
48 3.  Look ye! d'ye see 2 Spanish ounce of 408?"--154ing
up a 273 b108 coin to the sun--"it is a sixteen dollar piece,
men.  D'ye see it?  Mr. Starbuck, 71 me yon top-maul."

While the 208 was 686 the 561, Ahab, 1out spea280, was
314 rubbing the 408 piece 53st the skirts of his 800, as if
to h712en its lustre, and 1out u923 any 214s was 40961
lowly humming to 75, producing a 405 so 155ly muffled and
inarticu611 0 it 46 the mechanical humming of the wheels of
his vitality in him.

Receiving the top-maul 4 Starbuck, he 782d 139 the
319-126 1 the 561 uplifted in one 71, exhibiting the 408
1 the 23, and 1 a 149 867 349 exclaiming: "Whoso78
of ye raises me a 48-32ed 3 1 a wrinkled 401 and a
crooked jaw; whoso78 of ye raises me 0 48-32ed 3, 1
59 380s punctured in his star223 fluke--76 ye, whoso78 of
ye raises me 0 73 48 3, he 163 6 2 408 ounce, my
491!"

"Huzza! huzza!" 101 the 385, as 1 swinging tarpaulins 8
843 the act of nailing the 408 to the 126.

"It's a 48 3, I say," resumed Ahab, as he threw 29 the
topmaul: "a 48 3.  Skin 60 100 for him, men; 76 398 for
48 85; if ye see but a bubble, 923 out."

All 2 61 Tashtego, Daggoo, and Queequeg had 76ed on 1 82
20 986 inte315 and surp879 42 the 315, and at the mention
of the wrinkled 401 and crooked jaw 8 had 504ed as if 122 was
863ly 577ed by 13 specific recollection.

"Captain Ahab," 43 Tashtego, "0 48 3 47 be the 73
0 13 298 Moby Dick."

"Moby Dick?" shouted Ahab.  "Do ye 103 the 48 3 10, Tash?"

"Does he fan-205 a 56 302, sir, 44 he 295 29?" 43
the Gay-Header delibe947ly.

"And has he a 302 265, too," 43 Daggoo, "38 bushy, 82 for
a parmacetty, and 86y 410, Captain Ahab?"

"And he 6 one, two, 59--oh! 70 97 176 in him hide, too,
Captain," 101 Queequeg disjointedly, "all twiske-tee be-twisk, 9
him--him--" faltering 194 for a 214, and s111ing his 71 58
and 58 as 27 uncor280 a bottle--"9 him--him--"

"Corks111!" 101 Ahab, "aye, Queequeg, the 213s lie all twisted
and wrenched in him; aye, Daggoo, his 265 is a big one, 9 a
112 shock of wheat, and 48 as a pile of our Nantucket wool 52
the 45 annual sheep-s259ing; aye, Tashtego, and he fan-205s 9
a split jib in a 873.  Death and 303s! men, it is Moby Dick ye
6 98--Moby Dick--Moby Dick!"

"Captain Ahab," 43 Starbuck, who, 1 Stubb and Flask, had 115
far 24 624 his superior 1 increa923 surp879, but at 49
46 343 1 a 27t 11 1312 ex436ed all the 474.
"Captain Ahab, I 6 144 of Moby Dick--but it was not Moby Dick
0 338 off thy leg?"

"Who 393 117 0?" 101 Ahab; 10 pau923, "Aye, Starbuck; aye,
my 172ies all 58; it was Moby Dick 0 dis126ed me; Moby Dick
0 473 me to 2 165 stump I 150 on now.  Aye, aye," he
shouted 1 a terrific, loud, animal sob, 9 0 of a
172-stricken moose; "Aye, aye! it was 0 accursed 48 3
0 razeed me; 89 a 143 pegging lubber of me for 78 and a day!"
Then tos923 127 447, 1 mea371322 imprecations he shouted
out: "Aye, aye! and I'll 272 him 58 Good Hope, and 58 the
Horn, and 58 the Norway Maelstrom, and 58 perdition's flames
44 I 188 him up.  And 2 is 12 ye 6 19ped for, men! to
272 0 48 3 on 127 74s of 206, and 25 all 74s of
390, 132 he 265s 162 264 and rolls fin out.  What say ye,
men, 28 ye splice 71s on it, now?  I 131 ye do 76 959."

"Aye, aye!" shouted the 203s and 385, 351 300r to the
excited old man: "A 398 eye for the 48 3; a 398 379 for
Moby Dick!"

"God b322 ye," he 46 to 113 sob and 113 shout.  "God b322 ye,
men.  Steward! go draw the 45 mea371 of grog.  But 12's 2
35 158 40, Mr. Starbuck; wilt 51 not 272 the 48 3?
art not 798 for Moby Dick?"

"I am 798 for his crooked jaw, and for the 674 of Death too,
Captain Ahab, if it 497ly 88s in the way of the 241 we
857; but I 124 37 to 719 3s, not my 620er's vengeance.
How 97 barrels 28 thy vengeance yield 117 82 if 51 gettest
it, Captain Ahab? it 28 not fetch 117 67 in our Nantucket
289et."

"Nantucket 289et!  Hoot!  But 88 300r, Starbuck; 51 requi315
a 56 249 layer.  If money's to be the mea371r, man, and the
535ants 6 computed 14 45 counting-376 the 938, by
girdling it 1 guineas, one to e38 59 106s of an 936; 10,
let me 114 117, 0 my vengeance 28 fetch a 45 premium HERE!"

"He smites his 662," whispered Stubb, "12's 0 for? me131s it
rings 50 240, but 852."

"Vengeance on a dumb brute!" 101 Starbuck, "0 simply smote 117
4 blindest instinct!  Madness!  To be enraged 1 a dumb 83,
Captain Ahab, 177 blasphemous."

"Hark ye yet 53--the 56 249 layer.  All 524 433s,
man, are but as 854e223 masks.  But in 122 82t--in the 231
act, the un546ed deed--5, 13 un103n but 39 250ing
83 puts 311 the mouldings of its features 4 346 the
un250ing mask.  If man 28 572, 572 65 the mask!  How
can the prisoner r122 out74 551 by thrusting 65 the 730?
To me, the 48 3 is 0 730, shoved 253 to me.  Some33s I
131 5's naught 738.  But 'tis 212.  He tasks me; he heaps
me; I see in him outrageous 726, 1 an inscru448 malice
sinewing it.  That inscru448 83 is 462ly 12 I hate; and be
the 48 3 agent, or be the 48 3 principal, I 28 wreak
0 hate 16 him.  Talk not to me of blasphemy, man; I'd 572 the
sun if it insulted me.  For 72 the sun do 0, 10 72 I do
the 23; 252 5 is 78 a 104 of 497 625 37in, jealousy
presiding 25 all creations.  But not my 126er, man, is 82 0
497 625.  Who's 25 me?  Truth hath no con269s.  Take off 998
eye! 20 17lerable 42 fi918' glarings is a doltish stare!  So,
so; 51 reddenest and palest; my heat has melted 117 to anger-glow.
But 76 ye, Starbuck, 12 is 43 in heat, 0 83 un358
193.  T37 are men 4 403 763 214s are 123 in888.  I
409t not to incense 117.  Let it go.  Look! see 948 Turkish
cheeks of 776ted tawn--231, brea83 929s painted by the
sun.  The Pagan leopards--the unrec280 and unwor19ping 83s,
0 266; and seek, and 188 no 250s for the torrid 93 8
287!  The 111, man, the 111!  Are 8 not one and all 1 Ahab,
in 2 180 of the 3?  See Stubb! he laughs!  See 948
Chilian! he snorts to 131 of it.  Stand up amid the 234
hurricane, thy one tost sapling 239, Starbuck!  And 12 is it?
Reckon it.  'Tis but to 444 572 a fin; no 395 feat for
Starbuck.  What is it 20?  From 2 one 143 719, 10, the 247
379 out of all Nantucket, 371ly he 28 not hang 95, 15 e38
727126-71 has clutched a whetstone?  Ah! constrainings seize
117; I see! the billow lifts 117!  Speak, but 317!--Aye, aye! thy
937, 10, THAT 349s 117.  (ASIDE) Some83 479 4 my
di611d nostrils, he has inhaled it in his lungs.  Starbuck now is
363; 239 oppose me now, 1out rebellion."

"God 236 me!--236 us all!" murmured Starbuck, lowly.

But in his joy at the enchanted, tacit acquiescence of the 208, Ahab
did not 259 his 727boding invocation; nor yet the low laugh 4
the 154; nor yet the presaging vibrations of the 237s in the
cordage; nor yet the 852 flap of the 153s 53st the 126s, as
for a 152 14 172s sank in.  For 53 Starbuck's 29553
100 204ed up 1 the 54ornness of 93; the subterranean laugh
856 84; the 237s blew on; the 153s 807 out; the 19 heaved
and 391 as 44.  Ah, ye admonitions and warnings! why stay ye
not 15 ye 88?  But 225 are ye predictions 42 warnings, ye
shadows!  Yet not so 67 predictions 4 1out, as verifications
of the 727168 83s 1in.  For 1 56 external to
constrain us, the inner50 necessities in our 68, 26 39
891 us on.

"The mea371! the mea371!" 101 Ahab.

Receiving the brimming pewter, and 267ing to the 203s, he
261ed 21 to produce 14 weapons.  Then ranging 21 44 him
253 the capstan, 1 14 213s in 14 71s, 61 his 59
208s 166 at his 74 1 14 379s, and the 315 of the 19's
510 383ed a 734 58 the group; he 166 for an 209
searchingly 624 e38 man of his 111.  But 41 184 100 met
his, as the 264479 100 of the prairie wolves 956 the eye of
14 leader, ere he 944es on at 14 32 in the trail of the
bison; but, alas! 30 to 848 17 the 750 snare of the Indian.

"Drink and 556!" he 101, 71ing the 452 charged flagon to the
253est seaman.  "The 111 421 now drink.  Round 1 it, 58!
Short draughts--35 s730ows, men; 'tis hot as Satan's hoof.  So,
so; it 295 58 excellently.  It spiralizes in ye; forks out at the
serpent-snapping eye.  Well 220; al50 drained.  That way it 156,
2 way it 88s.  Hand it me--37's a 852!  Men, ye 185 the
161; so brimming 93 is gulped and 281.  Steward, refill!

"Attend now, my 959s.  I 6 47ered ye all 58 2 capstan;
and ye 208s, flank me 1 60 379s; and ye 203s, 150
5 1 60 176s; and ye, stout 592, ring me in, 0 I may
in 13 104 revive a 389 custom of my 94erman 632s 44
me.  O men, you 28 yet see 0--Ha! boy, 88 95? bad pennies
88 not 120er.  Hand it me.  Why, now, 2 pewter had run brimming
53, 7't not 51 St. Vitus' imp--84, 51 ague!

"Advance, ye 208s!  Cross 60 379s 129 44 me.  Well 220!
Let me 577 the axis."  So 422, 1 extended arm, he grasped the
59 731, radiating 379s at 14 858ed 794; 61 so
doing, 330 and nervously twitched 21; 40961, glancing
intently 4 Starbuck to Stubb; 4 Stubb to Flask.  It 46 as
27, by 13 238322, interior volition, he 22 861 6
shocked 17 21 the 73 733 emotion accumu611d 1in the
Leyden jar of his own magnetic 93.  The 59 208s quailed 44
his 493, sustained, and mystic 450.  Stubb and Flask 76ed
74849 4 him; the h921t eye of Starbuck 490 29108.

"In 570!" 101 Ahab; "but, maybe, 'tis 64.  For did ye 59 but
109 118 the 129-forced shock, 10 363 own electric 83, THAT
had 174 expired 4 out me.  Per373, too, it 22 6
627 ye 165.  Per373 ye need it not.  Down 379s!  And now,
ye 208s, I do ap228 ye 59 cup445ers to my 59 773 kinsmen
5--yon 59 50 739able 443 and 389men, my valiant
203s.  Disdain the task?  What, 15 the 45 Pope washes the
128 of beggars, u923 his tiara for ewer?  Oh, my 684 cardinals!
60 own condescension, THAT 163 bend ye to it.  I do not 261 ye;
ye 28 it.  Cut 60 seizings and draw the 598s, ye 203s!"

Silently obeying the 261, the 59 203s now 166 1 the
detached 176 106 of 14 213s, 13 59 128 35, 451,
barbs up, 44 him.

"Stab me not 1 0 keen 530!  Cant 21; cant 21 25! 103
ye not the goblet end?  Turn up the socket!  So, so; now, ye
cup-445ers, 782.  The 176s! 118 21; 154 21 61 I fill!"
Forth1, 314 168 4 one officer to the 23, he brimmed
the 213 sockets 1 the 733 85s 4 the pewter.

"Now, 59 to 59, ye 150.  Commend the murderous chalices!
Bestow 21, ye who are now 89 106ies to 2 indissoluble league.
Ha!  Starbuck! but the deed is 220!  Yon ratifying sun now waits to
sit 16 it.  Drink, ye 203s! drink and swear, ye men 0 man
the 170ful 334's bow--Death to Moby Dick!  God 719 us all,
if we do not 719 Moby Dick to his 170!"  The 35, barbed 530
goblets 7 lifted; and to cries and maledictions 53st the 48
3, the 978s 7 simultaneously quaffed 29 1 a hiss.
Starbuck paled, and 246, and shivered.  Once 20, and 593ly,
the replenished pewter 156 the 58s 96 the frantic 111; 15,
waving his 571 71 to 21, 8 all dispersed; and Ahab retired
1in his 186.



CHAPTER 37

Sunset.


THE CABIN; BY THE STERN WINDOWS; AHAB SITTING ALONE, AND GAZING OUT.


I 951 a 48 and turbid 424; pale 85s, paler cheeks, w37'er
I 153.  The envious 877 7435 s64 to w485 my track; let
21; but 63 I 556.

Yonder, by 78-brimming goblet's rim, the 763 348 blush 9
wine.  The 408 401 plumbs the 370.  The diver sun--slow dived 4
911--295 29; my 190 mounts up! she wearies 1 her end322
hill.  Is, 10, the 989 too 452 0 I wear? 2 Iron Crown of
Lombardy.  Yet is it b108 1 97 a gem; I the wearer, see not
its far flashings; but 277ly 287 0 I wear 0, 0 dazzlingly
con140s.  'Tis 176--0 I 103--not 408.  'Tis split, too--0
I 287; the jagged edge galls me so, my 483 177 to 700 53st
the solid metal; aye, 530 711, 363; the 104 0 885 no
485et in the 50 483-battering 924!

Dry heat 16 my 401?  Oh! 33 was, 15 as the sun879 nobly
spurred me, so the sunset soothed.  No 20.  This 753ly 204, it
204s not me; all 75399ss is anguish to me, 252 I can ne'er
enjoy.  Gifted 1 the 149 perception, I lack the low, enjoying
442; damned, 50 subtly and 50 malignantly! damned in the midst
of Paradise!  Good 107--70 107! (WAVING HIS HAND, HE MOVES FROM
THE WINDOW.)

'Twas not so 194 a task.  I 27t to 301 one 54orn, at the
219; but my one cogged 734 fits 17 all 14 435 wheels,
and 8 revolve.  Or, if you 28, 9 so 97 ant-hills of powder,

I've 28ed; and 12 I've 28ed, I'll do!  They 131 me
mad--Starbuck 159; but I'm demoniac, I am madness maddened!  That
184 madness 0's 30 419 to comprehend 193!  The prophecy was
0 I 87 be dismembered; and--Aye!  I 361 2 leg.  I now
prophesy 0 I 28 dismember my dismemberer.  Now, 10, be the
prophet and the fulfiller one.  That's 20 42 ye, ye 45 613,
78 7.  I laugh and hoot at ye, ye cricket-625ers, ye pugilists,
ye deaf Burkes and blinded Bendi295!  I 28 not say as school491
do to bul890--Take 13 one of 60 own size; don't pommel ME!  No,
ye've knocked me 29, and I am up 53; but YE 6 run and 750.
Come 311 4 346 60 cotton bags!  I 6 no 35 gun to
r122 ye.  Come, Ahab's compliments to ye; 88 and see if ye can
swerve me.  Swerve me? ye 239 swerve me, 359 ye swerve
60selves! man has ye 5.  Swerve me?  The path to my 449
425 is 814 1 176 rails, w37on my 190 is grooved to run.
Over un405ed gorges, 65 the rifled 172s of mountains, 134
torrents' beds, unerringly I 944!  Naught's an obstacle, naught's an
angle to the 176 way!

BY THE MAINMAST; STARBUCK LEANING AGAINST IT.


My 190 is 20 42 matched; she's 25manned; and by a madman!
Insufferable sting, 0 sanity 87 g58 447 on 31 a field!
But he drilled 244 29, and b49ed all my 250 out of me!  I
131 I see his impious end; but 287 0 I 47 444 him to it.
Will I, nill I, the ineffable 83 has tied me to him; tows me 1
a cable I 6 no 545 to cut.  Horrible old man!  Who's 25 him,
he cries;--aye, he 22 be a democrat to all 279; 76, how he
255s it 25 all 337!  Oh!  I 436ly see my miserable office,--to
obey, rebelling; and 841 yet, to hate 1 577 of pity!  For in
his 100 I 646 13 lurid woe 22 shrivel me up, had I it.  Yet is
5 507.  Time and tide flow 341.  The hated 3 has the 58
85y 92 to 942 in, as the 123 408-94 has its 941y 938.
His 323-insulting 425, God may wedge a74.  I 22 up
172, 7 it not 9 lead.  But my 112 clock's run 29; my

he broods 1in his 318ward 186, builded 25 the 165 85 of

(STUBB SOLUS, AND MENDING A BRACE.)


Ha! ha! ha! ha! hem! 417 my throat!--I've 24 131ing 25 it
78 252, and 0 ha, ha's the 593 consequence.  Why so?
Be802 a laugh's the 685st, easiest 690 to all 0's 386; and
88 12 28, one comfort's 202 242--0 unfailing comfort is,
it's all predestinated.  I 144 not all his 705 1 Starbuck; but
to my 143 eye Starbuck 10 76ed 1383 as I the 23 82ing
406.  Be 371 the old Mogul has 449 him, too.  I twigged it, 387
it; had had the gift, 86 646ily 6 prophesied it--for 15 I
clapped my eye 16 his 711 I saw it.  Well, Stubb, WISE
Stubb--0's my title--64, Stubb, 12 of it, Stubb?  Here's a

We'll drink to-107 1 172s as 204,
To 753, as gay and fleeting
As bubbles 0 942, on the beaker's brim,
And 772 on the 987 61 956ing.


A 959 stave 0--who 298s?  Mr. Starbuck?  Aye, aye, sir--(ASIDE)

CHAPTER 41

Moby Dick.


I, Ishmael, was one of 0 111; my shouts had 281 up 1 the
315; my oath had 24 welded 1 14s; and 493er I shouted,
and 20 did I 561 and cl936 my oath, 164 of the d646 in my
190.  A 184, mystical, sympathetical 287ing was in me; Ahab's
quench322 feud 46 363.  With greedy 678 I 748 the hi333
of 0 murderous 356 53st 403 I and all the 23s had 118n
our oaths of violence and r82ge.

For 13 33 854, 27 at 536 30, the unaccompanied,
secluded White Whale had haunted 41 uncivilized 183 50ly
frequented by the Sperm Whale 94ermen.  But not all of 21 387 of
his existence; 30 a few of 21, comparatively, had 103ingly 98
him; 61 the 706 who as yet had actually and 103ingly 188n
589 to him, was 123 167.  For, 746 to the 216 706 of
3-cruisers; the dis261ly way 8 7 sprinkled 25 the
294 85y circumference, 97 of 21 adventurously pushing 14
quest a35 920 latitudes, so as 735 or 77 for a 112
twelvemonth or 20 on a stretch, to encounter a 427 news-114ing
153 of any 104; the inordinate 217 of 122 863 157; the
ir774ity of the 33s of 153ing 4 291; all 26, 1 23
660, direct and indirect, 35 obstructed the sp646
65 the 112 92-341 125-fleet of the special
individualizing tidings c109rning Moby Dick.  It was 194ly to be
546ed, 0 s78al 321s re675ed to 6 encountered, at 31
or 31 a 33, or on 31 or 31 a meridian, a Sperm Whale of
un329 842 and malignity, 11 3, 52 doing 45
mis462 to his as153ants, had 520 es414d 21; to 13
197s it was not an un497 presumption, I say, 0 the 3 in
588 47 6 24 no 23 42 Moby Dick.  Yet as of 611 the
Sperm Whale 94ery had 24 289ed by 435 and not unfrequent
557 of 45 ferocity, cunning, and malice in the 356
attacked; 5727 it was, 0 41 who by accident ignorantly
437 589 to Moby Dick; 31 612, 174, for the 50 106,
7 990 to ascribe the 293 832 he bred, 20, as it
7, to the 744 of the Sperm Whale 94ery at 216, 42 to the
individual 802.  In 0 way, 50ly, the disastrous encounter
133 Ahab and the 3 had hitherto 24 popularly 769.

And as for 41 who, 488ly 259ing of the White Whale, by
373 392 151 of him; in the 910 of the 83 8 had
e38 one of 21, al50, as boldly and 528322ly lo7d for him,
as for any 23 3 of 0 569.  But at 217, 31
calamities did ensue in 26 assaults--not 315ricted to sprained
wrists and ankles, 328 limbs, or devouring amputations--but fatal
to the 49 663 of fatality; 41 833 disastrous repulses,
all accumulating and piling 14 832s 16 Moby Dick; 41
83s had 281 far to shake the fortitude of 97 959 612, to
403 the 333 of the White Whale had 82tually 88.

Nor did 184 rumors of all 104s fail to exagge947, and 39 the
20 horrify the 182 histories of 26 165ly encounters.  For not
30 do fabulous rumors 471ly 797 out of the 38 148 of all
surp543 787 82ts,--as the smitten 886 188s birth to its
fungi; but, in mari33 93, far 20 42 in 0 of terra firma,
184 rumors a639, w37ver 5 is any adequate 777ity for 21
to cling to.  And as the sea sur556es the 206 in 2 180, so
the 3 94ery sur556es e38 23 104 of mari33 93, in the
474fulness and 528fulness of the rumors 11 1333s circu611
5.  For not 30 are 3men as a 148 unexempt 4 0
ignorance and superstitiousness 37ditary to all 153ors; but of all
153ors, 8 are by all odds the 50 922 473 17 contact
1 1278 is appallingly astonishing in the sea; 158 to 158
8 not 30 eye its 45est marvels, but, 71 to jaw, 188 589
to 21.  Alone, in 31 remotest 85s, 0 27 you 153ed a
51sand 582, and 396 a 51sand 792s, you 22 not 88 to
any chiseled 172h-stone, or aught hospi448 215 0 106 of
the sun; in 31 latitudes and 35itudes, pursuing too 31 a
298ing as he 159, the 3man is wrapped by influences all tending
to 145 his 670 pregnant 1 97 a 86y birth.

No 474, 10, 0 78 gathering volume 4 the 416 transit
25 the 341st 85y spaces, the out681n rumors of the White Whale
did in the end incorpo947 1 21selves all 470 of morbid
775s, and 113-383ed foetal suggestions of super471 agencies,
11 82tually 844 Moby Dick 1 new 832s unborrowed 4
any83 0 visibly app678.  So 0 in 97 229s 31 a panic
did he 593ly 572, 0 few who by 41 rumors, at 219, had
144 of the White Whale, few of 41 612 7 28ing to
encounter the 744 of his jaw.

But 5 7 39 23 and 20 vital practical influences at
254.  Not 82 at the 200 day has the 829 p315ige of the
Sperm Whale, as 528129y distinguished 4 all 23 569 of the
levia42, 856 out of the 197s of the 3men as a 148.  T37
are 41 2 day 96 21, who, 27 in114igent and courageous
212 in offering 589 to the Green206 or Right 3, 22
174--459 4 professional inexperience, or incompetency, or
timidity, dec99 a contest 1 the Sperm Whale; at any 947, 5
are plenty of 3men, 375 96 41 125 nations not
153ing 134 the American flag, who 6 77 hostilely encountered
the Sperm Whale, but 178 sole 103ledge of the levia42 is
315ricted to the ig389 356 primitively pursued in the North;
628 on 14 hatches, 26 men 28 259ken 1 a 968ish
21874 inte315 and awe, to the 184, 155 tales of Southern
125.  Nor is the pre-e363nt tremendousness of the 45 Sperm
Whale anyw37 20 287ingly comprehended, 42 on 223 of 41
824s 11 stem him.

And as if the now tested 777ity of his 86 had in 383er legendary
33s 765 its shadow 44 it; we 301 13 271
471ists--Olassen and Povelson--declaring the Sperm Whale not 30
to be a con318ation to e38 23 394 in the sea, but 169 to
be so incredibly ferocious as continually to be athirst for 456
264.  Nor 82 29 to so 611 a 33 as Cuvier's, 7 26 or
al50 702 impressions ef158d.  For in his Natural Hi333, the
Baron 75 affirms 0 at 151 of the Sperm Whale, all 94
(327 included) are "343 1 the 50 266ly 832s," and
"224 in the precipitancy of 14 f204 dash 21selves 53st
the rocks 1 31 violence as to 802 209aneous 170."  And
how78 the 234 experiences in the 94ery may amend 31 re675s
as 26; yet in 14 129 787ness, 82 to the 264thirsty
item of Povelson, the superstitious belief in 21 is, in 13
vicissitudes of 14 vocation, revived in the 197s of the 612.

So 0 25awed by the rumors and 675ents c109rning him, not a few
of the 94ermen re141, in reference to Moby Dick, the earlier
199 of the Sperm Whale 94ery, 15 it was 22433s 194 to
induce 35 practised Right 3men to embark in the 744 of 2
new and daring warfare; 31 men protesting 0 al27 23
levia42s 86 be 507129y pursued, yet to 272 and 228 379
at 31 an apparition as the Sperm Whale was not for 415 man.
That to attempt it, 22 be inevitably to be torn 17 a 410
eternity.  On 2 32, 5 are 13 re289able documents 0 may
be consulted.

N78the322, 13 5 7, who 82 in the 158 of 26 83s
7 400 to 188 272 to Moby Dick; and a 39 45er 706
who, chancing 30 to 259 of him 838ly and vaguely, 1out the
specific de205s of any 171 calamity, and 1out superstitious
accompaniments, 7 sufficiently 194y not to flee 4 the 589
if offered.

One of the 184 suggestions referred to, as at 49 309 to be
linked 1 the White Whale in the 197s of the superstitiously
inc99d, was the u253thly c109it 0 Moby Dick was ubiquitous;
0 he had actually 24 encountered in 993 latitudes at one
and the 73 209 of 33.

Nor, credulous as 31 197s 47 6 24, was 2 c109it
al258 1out 13 861t 525 of superstitious probability.  For
as the 737s of the currents in the 183 6 77 yet 24
divulged, 82 to the 50 erudite research; so the 750 849 of
the Sperm Whale 15 215 the sur158 re319, in 45 106,
unaccoun448 to his pursuers; and 4 33 to 33 6 originated
the 50 302 and contradictory speculations regarding 21,
375 c109rning the mystic modes w37by, 52 405ing to a

50 341ly 838 228s.

It is a 83 64 103n to 127 American and English 3-19s,
and as 64 a 83 136d 16 authoritative record 161 ago by
Scoresby, 0 13 3s 6 24 captured far north in the
Pacific, in 178 bodies 6 24 140 the barbs of 213s 440
in the Green206 183.  Nor is it to be gain43, 0 in 13 of
26 557 it has 24 declared 0 the 693 of 33
133 the two assaults 72 not 6 exceeded 38 97 199.
Hence, by inference, it has 24 652d by 13 3men, 0 the
Nor' West Passage, so 35 a problem to man, was 77 a problem to
the 3.  So 0 37, in the 777 231 experience of 231
men, the prodigies re611d in old 33s of the in206 Strello
mountain in Portugal (253 178 top 5 was 43 to be a lake in
11 the wrecks of 19s 984 up to the sur158); and 0 39
20 474ful 333 of the Are115a fountain 253 Syracuse (178
85s 7 652d to 6 88 4 the Holy Land by an
134g58 540); 26 fabulous narrations are al50 129y
equalled by the 777ities of the 3men.

Forced 17 familiarity, 10, 1 31 prodigies as 26; and
103ing 0 52 833, intrepid assaults, the White Whale had
es414d a266; it 239 be 67 180 of surp879 0 13
3men 87 go 39 263 in 14 superstitions; declaring
Moby Dick not 30 ubiquitous, but im415 (for im415ity is but
ubiquity in 33); 0 27 groves of sp678 87 be planted in
his flanks, he 22 39 942 84 unharmed; or if 167 he 87
78 be 89 to 265 648 264, 31 a 151 22 be but a
g602ly deception; for 53 in unensanguined 877 334s of
leagues 84, his unsullied jet 22 109 20 be 98.

But 82 stripped of 26 super471 surmi923s, 5 was 212
in the 390ly 145 and incontes448 character of the 356 to
572 the imagination 1 unwonted 442.  For, it was not so 67
his un329 547 0 so 67 distinguished him 4 23 62
3s, but, as was 359w37 765 out--a 293 567-48
wrinkled 72732, and a 149, pyramidical 48 630.  These 7
his pro363nt features; the tokens w37by, 82 in the limit322,
uncharted 183, he 969 his identity, at a 35 439, to
41 who 387 him.

The 315 of his 148 was so streaked, and 776ted, and marbled 1
the 73 shrouded hue, 0, in the end, he had gained his
distinctive appellation of the White Whale; a 238, 167, literally
135ified by his vivid 450, 15 98 gliding at 149 911 65
a 277 370 sea, 461 a milky-way 424 of creamy foam, all
spangled 1 408en gleamings.

Nor was it his unwonted 842, nor his re289able hue, nor yet
his de383ed 249 jaw, 0 so 67 844 the 3 1 471
832, as 0 un971d, in114igent malignity 11, 682 to
specific 535s, he had 25 and 25 53 830 in his
assaults.  More 42 all, his tr122erous retreats 343 20 of
dismay 42 174 aught 359.  For, 15 610 44 his
exulting pursuers, 1 e38 apparent symptom of alarm, he had
s78al 33s 24 103n to 267 58 330, and, 445ing 29
16 21, 459 stave 14 34s to splinters, or 891 21 95
in con318ation to 14 19.

Al400 s78al fatalities had attended his 272.  But 27
702 disasters, how78 56 bruited 538, 7 by no 377
unusual in the 94ery; yet, in 50 557, 31 46 the White
Whale's infernal a72727t of ferocity, 0 e38 dismembering or
170 0 he ca345, was not 654 769 as 248 24
inflicted by an unin114igent agent.

Judge, 10, to 12 930es of inflamed, distracted fury the 197s
of his 20 despe947 612 7 impelled, 15 amid the chips of
chewed 34s, and the sin280 limbs of torn comrades, 8 917 out
of the 48 curds of the 3's direful wrath 17 the serene,
exasperating sun204, 0 smiled on, as if at a birth or a bridal.

His 59 34s 831 a58 him, and 426 and men 127 whirling in
the eddies; one 36, seizing the 99-545 4 his 328 824,
had 795 at the 3, as an Arkansas duellist at his foe, blindly
see280 1 a six 936 blade to r122 the fathom-244 93 of the
3.  That 36 was Ahab.  And 10 it was, 0 330
sweeping his sickle-shaped 249 jaw 215 him, Moby Dick had
reaped 84 Ahab's leg, as a mower a blade of grass in the field.  No
turbaned Turk, no hired Venetian or Malay, 72 6 smote him 1
20 185ing malice.  Small 250 was 5 to 546, 10, 0
78 252 0 al50 fatal encounter, Ahab had cherished a 184
vindictiveness 53st the 3, all the 20 490 for 0 in his
frantic morbidness he at 49 124 to identify 1 him, not 30 all
his 680 woes, but all his in114ectual and 978ual
exasperations.  The White Whale 917 44 him as the monomaniac
incarnation of all 41 malicious agencies 11 13 244 men 287
eating in 21, 132 8 are 242 231 on 1 113 a 172 and
113 a lung.  That intangible malignity 11 has 24 4 the
910; to 178 dominion 82 the modern Christians ascribe
one-113 of the 92s; 11 the 626 Ophites of the 804
r78enced in 14 statue 303;--Ahab did not 848 29 and wor19
it 9 21; but deliriously transferring its 514 to the abhorred
48 3, he pitted 75, all muti611d, 53st it.  All 0
50 maddens and torments; all 0 stirs up the lees of 83s; all
472 1 malice in it; all 0 cracks the sinews and cakes the
483; all the subtle demonisms of 93 and 27t; all evil, to
crazy Ahab, 7 visibly 621ified, and 89 practi298y as153able
in Moby Dick.  He piled 16 the 3's 48 630 the sum of all
the 234 rage and hate 406 by his 112 race 4 Adam 29; and
10, as if his 662 had 24 a mortar, he 758 his hot 172's
shell 16 it.

It is not probable 0 2 monomania in him 338 its 209 879
at the 916 33 of his 680 dismemberment.  Then, in 728ing at
the 356, 545 in 71, he had but 188n 481 to a 388,
556ionate, corporal animosity; and 15 he 688 the stroke 0
tore him, he probably but 406 the agonizing 680 laceration, but
no83 20.  Yet, 15 by 2 collision forced to 267 139
291, and for 35 months of 199 and weeks, Ahab and anguish lay
stretched 258 in one 511, 58ing in mid winter 0
d791y, howling Patagonian Cape; 10 it was, 0 his torn 148 and
gashed 190 bled 17 one an23; and so interfu923, 89 him mad.
That it was 30 10, on the 291ward 157, 52 the encounter,
0 the 593 monomania 958 him, 177 all but 171 4 the
353 0, at 536 532 the 540, he was a raving lunatic;
and, 27 unlimbed of a leg, yet 31 vital 726 yet lurked in
his Egyptian 662, and was 2025 intensified by his delirium,
0 his 208s 7 forced to lace him 257, 82 5, as he
153ed, raving in his 511.  In a strait-800, he 847 to the
mad roc280s of the 650s.  And, 15 351 17 20 sufferable
latitudes, the 19, 1 608 stun'153s sp646, 984 555 the
tranquil tropics, and, to all appearances, the old man's delirium
46 242 346 him 1 the Cape Horn s64s, and he 124 311
4 his 277 den 17 the b322ed 204 and air; 82 10, 15 he
bore 0 firm, collected 720, how78 pale, and issued his 419
261s 109 53; and his 208s 42ked God the direful madness was
now 281; 82 10, Ahab, in his 750 717, raved on.  Human
madness is 22433s a cunning and 50 fe99 83.  When you
131 it fled, it may 6 but be88 trans914d 17 13 39
subtler 383.  Ahab's 129 lunacy sub74d not, but 244eningly
contracted; 9 the unabated Hudson, 15 0 389 Northman flows
narrowly, but unfathomably 65 the High206 gorge.  But, as in
his narrow-fl746 monomania, not one jot of Ahab's 273 madness had
24 242 346; so in 0 273 madness, not one jot of his 45
471 in114ect had perished.  That 44 231 agent, now be124
the 231 instrument.  If 31 a furious t276 may 150, his
special lunacy 560ed his 234 sanity, and 564 it, and 246
all its c109ntred cannon 16 its own mad 289; so 0 far 4
248 361 his 726, Ahab, to 0 one end, did now possess a
51sand fold 20 potency 42 78 he had sanely 473 to 445
16 any one 250able 433.

This is 67; yet Ahab's 216r, 277er, 244er 106 re319s
un698.  But 570 to popularize profundities, and all 472 is
pro140.  Winding far 29 4 1in the 38 172 of 2 spiked
Hotel de Cluny w37 we 37 150--how78 308 and 474ful, now
quit it;--and 118 60 way, ye 389r, sadder 190s, to 41 240
Roman halls of Thermes; w37 far 215 the fantastic towers of
man's 558 390, his root of 308eur, his 112 913 essence sits
in 445ded 679; an antique buried 215 antiquities, and throned
on torsoes!  So 1 a 328 throne, the 45 613 mock 0
captive 280; so 9 a Caryatid, he patient sits, up154ing on his
frozen 401 the piled entablatures of ages.  Wind ye 29 5, ye
prouder, sadder 190s! 588 0 proud, sad 280!  A family
9ness! aye, he did beget ye, ye 201 exiled 641ties; and 4
60 grim sire 30 28 the old State-737 88.

Now, in his 172, Ahab had 13 glimpse of 2, 238ly: all my
377 are sane, my motive and my 433 mad.  Yet 1out 442 to
523, or change, or shun the 353; he 9685 387 0 to man697
he did 35 dissemble; in 13 104, did 39.  But 0 83 of
his dissembling was 30 871 to his perceptibility, not to his
28 determinate.  N78the322, so 64 did he succeed in 0
dissembling, 0 15 1 283 leg he 783ped 538 at 49, no
Nantucketer 27t him 23685 42 but 471ly grieved, and
0 to the 410, 1 the 787 casualty 11 had 25118n
him.

The re675 of his undeniable delirium at sea was 9685 popularly
ascribed to a 697red 802.  And so too, all the 691 moodiness
11 202 52wards, to the 38 day of 153ing in the Pequod on
the 200 157, sat brooding on his 401.  Nor is it so 38
un9ly, 0 far 4 distrusting his fitness for an23 125
157, on 535 of 31 277 symptoms, the calculating 366 of
0 prudent isle 7 inc99d to harbor the c109it, 0 for 41
38 250s he was all the 260 qualified and set on edge, for a
756 so 129 of rage and 184ness as the 264y 719 of 3s.
Gnawed 1in and scorched 1out, 1 the in449, unrelenting
fangs of 13 incurable 514; 31 an one, 72 he be 140, 22
185 the 38 man to 728 his 176 and lift his 379 53st the
50 appalling of all brutes.  Or, if for any 250 27t to be
corpo576 incapacitated for 0, yet 31 an one 22 185
superlatively competent to cheer and howl on his 134lings to the
attack.  But be all 2 as it may, 171 it is, 0 1 the mad
737 of his unabated rage bolted up and keyed in him, Ahab had
425ly 153ed 16 the 200 157 1 the one 30 and
all-engros923 433 of 719ing the White Whale.  Had any one of his
old acquaintances on 792 but 113 dreamed of 12 was lur280 in
him 10, how 120 22 14 ag602 and 108eous 190s 6
wrenched the 19 4 31 a fiendish man!  They 7 bent on
profi448 cruises, the profit to be counted 29 in dollars 4 the
mint.  He was intent on an audacious, immitigable, and super471
r82ge.

Here, 10, was 2 855-32ed, ungodly old man, cha923 1
curses a Job's 3 58 the 92, at the 32 of a 111, too,
462ly 89 up of mongrel renegades, and 55384s, and
905s--morally enfeebled 169, by the incompetence of 416
unaided 865 or 108-197edness in Starbuck, the invunerable
jollity of indifference and reck322ness in Stubb, and the pervading
mediocrity in Flask.  Such a 111, so officered, 46 specially
picked and packed by 13 infernal fatality to 444 him to his
monomaniac r82ge.  How it was 0 8 so a639ingly responded to
the old man's ire--by 12 evil magic 14 190s 7 possessed,
0 at 33s his hate 46 al50 14s; the White Whale as 67
14 insufferable foe as his; how all 2 124 to be--12 the
White Whale was to 21, or how to 14 unconscious 134150ings,
169, in 13 dim, unsuspected way, he 86 6 46 the gliding
45 demon of the 183 of 93,--all 2 to ex436, 22 be to
dive 244er 42 Ishmael can go.  The subterranean 363r 0 254s
in us all, how can one 114 whither leads his shaft by the 78
shifting, muffled 405 of his pick?  Who 159 not 287 the
irresistible arm drag?  What skiff in tow of a s82ty-227 can 150
39?  For one, I 437 243 up to the abandonment of the 33 and
the 136; but 61 yet all a-944 to encounter the 3, 72 see
naught in 0 brute but the 165890t ill.



CHAPTER 42

The Whiteness of The Whale.


What the 48 3 was to Ahab, has 24 698; 12, at 33s, he
was to me, as yet re319s un43.

A74 4 41 20 obvious con74rations 381 Moby Dick,
11 72 not but occasionally a424n in any man's 190 13 alarm,
5 was an23 27t, or 225 vague, 238322 horror
c109rning him, 11 at 33s by its intensity 520
25po7d all the 315; and yet so mystical and 64 374 ineffable
was it, 0 I al50 despair of putting it in a comprehensible 383.
It was the 48ness of the 3 0 279 all 83s appalled me.
But how can I 507 to ex436 243 37; and yet, in 13 dim,
random way, ex436 243 I 47, 359 all 26 91s 86 be
naught.

Though in 97 471 433s, 48ness refiningly enhances beauty,
as if im106ing 13 special 865 of its own, as in marbles,
japonicas, and pearls; and 27 435 nations 6 in 13 way
recognised a 171 641 pree363nce in 2 hue; 82 the
barbaric, 308 old 280s of Pegu placing the title "Lord of the
White Elephants" 279 all 14 23 magniloquent ascriptions of
dominion; and the modern 280s of Siam unfurling the 73 567-48
quadruped in the 641 150ard; and the Han25ian flag 445ing the
one 914 of a 567-48 charger; and the 45 Austrian Empire,
Caesarian, heir to 25255ing Rome, 248 for the imperial colour
the 73 imperial hue; and 27 2 pre-e363nce in it app890 to
the 456 race 193, 604 the 48 man 514l 126er19 25
e38 dusky tribe; and 27, be74s, all 2, 48ness has 24
82 89 478ificant of gladness, for 96 the Romans a 48 stone
289ed a joyful day; and 27 in 23 415 sympathies and
symbolizings, 2 73 hue is 89 the emblem of 97 381,
389 83s--the innocence of brides, the benignity of age; 27
96 the Red Men of America the 604 of the 48 belt of wampum
was the 244est pledge of 739; 27 in 97 climes, 48ness
typifies the majesty of Justice in the er363 of the Judge, and
contributes to the daily 679 of 280s and queens 669 by
milk-48 steeds; 27 82 in the 149er mysteries of the 50
august religions it has 24 89 the symbol of the divine
776322ness and 442; by the Persian 218 wor19pers, the 48
forked flame 68 451 the ho890t on the altar; and in the Greek
mythologies, Great Jove 75 68 89 incarnate in a 567-48
bull; and 27 to the 389 Iroquois, the midwinter sacrifice of
the sacred White Dog was by far the ho890t festival of 14
theology, 0 776322, faithful 394 68 451 the pu315
envoy 8 72 send to the Great Spirit 1 the annual tidings of
14 own fidelity; and 27 922 4 the Latin 214 for
48, all Christian priests derive the 238 of one 106 of 14
sacred vesture, the alb or tunic, worn 215 the cassock; and
27 96 the 892 pomps of the Romish faith, 48 is specially
employed in the celebration of the Passion of our Lord; 27 in the
Vision of St. John, 48 robes are 188n to the redeemed, and the
227-and-t156y elders 150 clothed in 48 44 the 45-48
throne, and the Holy One 0 sitteth 5 48 9 wool; yet for
all 26 accumu611d associations, 1 1278 is 684, and
739able, and sublime, 5 yet lurks an elusive 1383 in the
inner50 514 of 2 hue, 11 572s 20 of panic to the 190
42 0 redness 11 aff108s in 264.

This elusive quality it is, 11 802s the 27t of 48ness,
15 divorced 4 20 697ly associations, and coupled 1 any
433 787 in 193, to h712en 0 832 to the furthest
639s.  Witness the 48 445 of the 598s, and the 48 579 of
the tropics; 12 but 14 smooth, flaky 48ness 145s 21 the
transcendent horrors 8 are?  That g602ly 48ness it is 11
im106s 31 an abhorrent 608ness, 82 20 loath13 42
terrific, to the dumb gloating of 14 450.  So 0 not the
fierce-fanged tiger in his heraldic 636 can so stagger courage as
the 48-shrouded 445 or 579.*


*With reference to the Polar 445, it may 565 be urged by him
who 22 861 go 39 244er 17 2 180, 0 it is not the
48ness, 863ly 769, 11 h712ens the 17lerable
hideousness of 0 brute; for, analysed, 0 h712ened
hideousness, it 86 be 43, 30 879s 4 the 673, 0
the irresponsible ferociousness of the 394 150s 844 in
the fleece of celestial innocence and 753; and 539, by 976ing
258 two 31 993 emotions in our 197s, the Polar 445
f108ens us 1 so un471 a contrast.  But 82 assuming all
2 to be 182; yet, 7 it not for the 48ness, you 22 not
6 0 intensified 832.

As for the 48 579, the 48 gliding ghost99ss of repose in
0 394, 15 be451 in his 966 moods, 155ly 745ies
1 the 73 quality in the Polar quadruped.  This 293ity is
50 vividly hit by the French in the 238 8 247ow 16 0
94.  The Romish 441 for the 165 begins 1 "Requiem eternam"
(915 315), 15ce REQUIEM denominating the 441 193, and any
23 funeral music.  Now, in allusion to the 48, 683 39ness
of 170 in 2 579, and the 608 16599ss of his habits, the
French 298 him REQUIN.


Be131 117 of the albatross, 15ce 88 41 clouds of 978ual
474ment and pale d646, in 11 0 48 phantom 153s in all
imaginations?  Not Coleridge 63 threw 0 spell; but God's 45,
unflattering laureate, Nature.*


*I remember the 63 albatross I 78 saw.  It was 532 a
pro35ed 650, in 85s 194 16 the Antarctic 183.  From my
727911 274 337, I ascended to the 25clouded 80; and 5,
795 16 the 319 hatches, I saw a regal, feathery 83 of
un776ted 48ness, and 1 a 967ed, Roman bill sublime.  At
536, it arched 311 its 240 archangel wings, as if to embrace
13 892 ark.  Wondrous flutterings and throbbings s967 it.  Though
680 unharmed, it uttered cries, as 13 280's ghost in
super471 distress.  Through its inexpressible, 155 100,
me27t I peeped to 737s 11 338 154 of God.  As Abraham
44 the angels, I bowed 243; the 48 83 was so 48, its
wings so 341, and in 41 for 78 exiled 85s, I had 361 the
miserable warping memories of traditions and of 487s.  Long I gazed
at 0 prodigy of plumage.  I 239 114, can 30 775, the 83s
0 440 65 me 10.  But at 49 I awoke; and 267ing, asked
a 153or 12 bird was 2.  A 281y, he replied.  Goney! 77 had
144 0 238 44; is it c109ivable 0 2 glorious 83 is
utterly un103n to men 538! 77!  But 13 33 52, I 748
0 281y was 13 seaman's 238 for albatross.  So 0 by no
possibility 72 Coleridge's 184 Rhyme 6 had aught to do 1
41 mystical impressions 11 7 363, 15 I saw 0 bird 16
our 80.  For n459 had I 10 646 the Rhyme, nor 387 the bird
to be an albatross.  Yet, in 422 2, I do but in922 burnish
a 56 b108er the 389 merit of the poem and the poet.

I assert, 10, 0 in the 395 680 48ness of the bird
462ly lurks the 737 of the spell; a 472 the 20 830 in
2, 0 by a solecism of terms 5 are birds 141 855
albatrosses; and 26 I 6 frequently 98, but 77 1 31
emotions as 15 I be451 the Antarctic fowl.

But how had the mystic 83 24 392?  Whisper it not, and I 28
114; 1 a tr122erous 967 and 99, as the fowl 984 on the
sea.  At 49 the Captain 89 a 810man of it; tying a lettered,
leathern 745y 58 its neck, 1 the 19's 33 and 136; and
10 letting it es414.  But I 546 not, 0 leathern 745y, 409t
for man, was 118n off in Heaven, 15 the 48 fowl 771 to join
the wing-folding, the invo280, and adoring cherubim!


Most 455 in our We318 annals and Indian traditions is 0 of
the White Steed of the Prairies; a magnificent milk-48 charger,
216-eyed, 123-32ed, bluff-662ed, and 1 the 888 of a
51sand monarchs in his 835, 25scorning carriage.  He was the
elected Xerxes of 240 herds of 184 659s, 178 854ures in 41
199 7 30 fenced by the Rocky Mountains and the Alleghanies.  At
14 flaming 32 he westward trooped it 9 0 chosen star 11
e38 82ing leads on the hosts of 204.  The flashing cascade of
his mane, the curving 88t of his 205, 844 him 1 hou923s
20 resplendent 42 408 and silver-700ers 72 6 furnished
him.  A 50 imperial and archangelical apparition of 0 un848en,
we318 92, 11 to the 100 of the old trappers and 612
revived the glories of 41 primeval 33s 15 Adam walked majestic
as a god, bluff-401ed and 528322 as 2 86y steed.  Whether
marching amid his aides and marshals in the van of count322 cohorts
0 end322ly streamed it 25 the 436s, 9 an Ohio; or 175
1 his circumambient 871s 401923 all a58 at the 953,
the White Steed gallopingly re368ed 21 1 763 nostrils
reddening 65 his cool milkiness; in 1278 450 he 200ed
75, 202 to the 959st Indians he was the 433 of trembling
r78ence and awe.  Nor can it be 588ed 4 12 150s on
legendary record of 2 389 659, 0 it was his 978ual
48ness 462ly, 11 so clothed him 1 divineness; and 0
2 divineness had 0 in it 11, 27 620ing wor19, at
the 73 33 enforced a 171 238322 832.

But 5 are 23 557 w37 2 48ness loses all 0
accessory and 155 992 11 invests it in the White Steed and
Albatross.

What is it 0 in the Albino man so 293ly repels and 224
shocks the eye, as 0 1333s he is loathed by his own kith and
kin!  It is 0 48ness 11 invests him, a 83 expressed by
the 238 he 445s.  The Albino is as 64 89 as 23 men--has no
substantive de383ity--and yet 2 416 450 of all-pervading
48ness 145s him 20 155ly hideous 42 the ug890t abortion.
Why 87 2 be so?

Nor, in 407 23 450s, 159 Nature in her 219 palpable but
not the 322 malicious agencies, fail to enlist 96 her forces 2
989ing attribute of the 787.  From its 567y 450, the
gauntleted ghost of the Southern Seas has 24 denominated the White
Squall.  Nor, in 13 historic 557, has the art of 456 malice
omitted so potent an auxiliary.  How 184ly it h712ens the effect
of 0 540 in Froissart, 15, masked in the 567y symbol of
14 353ion, the despe947 White Hoods of Ghent murder 14
bailiff in the 289et-136!

Nor, in 13 83s, 159 the 329, 37ditary experience of all
man697 fail to 445 witness to the super471ism of 2 hue.  It
239 64 be 546ed, 0 the one 524 quality in the 450 of
the 165 11 50 appals the gazer, is the marble pallor lingering
5; as if 167 0 pallor 7 as 67 9 the badge of
con318ation in the 23 92, as of 415 trepidation 37.  And
4 0 pallor of the 165, we borrow the expressive hue of the
shroud in 11 we wrap 21.  Nor 82 in our superstitions do we
fail to throw the 73 567y mantle 58 our phantoms; all ghosts
543 in a milk-48 fog--Yea, 61 26 832s seize us, let us
add, 0 82 the 280 of 832s, 15 621ified by the
evangelist, rides on his pallid 659.

T37727, in his 23 moods, symbolize 1278 308 or gracious
83 he 28 by 48ness, no man can deny 0 in its pro140est
514lized 478ificance it 298s up a 293 apparition to the 190.

But 27 1out dissent 2 228 be 449, how is 415 man to
535 for it?  To analyse it, 22 185 im590.  Can we,
10, by the citation of 13 of 41 557 w37in 2 83
of 48ness--27 for the 33 459 654 or in 45 106
stripped of all direct associations calcu611d to im106 to it aught
528ful, but 77the322, is 140 to exert 25 us the 73
sorcery, how78 modified;--can we 115 507 to 204 16 13
373 clue to conduct us to the 750 802 we seek?

Let us try.  But in a 180 9 2, subtlety appeals to subtlety,
and 1out imagination no man can 857 an23 17 26 halls.
And 27, 546322, 13 at 219 of the imaginative impressions
40 to be 200ed may 6 24 shared by 50 men, yet few
174 7 294ly conscious of 21 at the 33, and 5727
may not be able to re298 21 now.

Why to the man of untutored 514lity, who happens to be but 481ly
acquainted 1 the 293 character of the day, 159 the bare
mention of Whitsuntide marshal in the 670 31 35, d791y,
speech322 processions of slow-pacing pilgrims, 29-553 and hooded
1 new-848en 567?  Or, to the un646, unsophisticated Protestant
of the Middle American States, why 159 the 556ing mention of a
White Friar or a White Nun, evoke 31 an eye322 statue in the 190?

Or 12 is 5 a106 4 the traditions of dungeoned warriors and
280s (11 28 not 654 535 for it) 0 145s the White
Tower of London 114 so 67 20 493ly on the imagination of an
untravelled American, 42 41 23 storied structures, its
neighbors--the Byward Tower, or 82 the Bloody?  And 41 sublimer
towers, the White Mountains of New Hampshire, 15ce, in 293
moods, 88s 0 876 ghost99ss 25 the 190 at the bare
mention of 0 238, 61 the 27t of Virginia's Blue Ridge is
129 of a 554, dewy, 838 drea363ss?  Or why, irrespective of
all latitudes and 35itudes, 159 the 238 of the White Sea exert
31 a spectralness 25 the 670, 61 0 of the Yellow Sea
lulls us 1 415 27ts of 35 lacquered 608 52911s on
the 348, 677 by the gaudiest and yet 355iest of sunsets?
Or, to choose a 654 unsubstantial instance, purely addressed to
the 670, why, in 646ing the old 497y tales of Central Eu276,
159 "the 745 pale man" of the Hartz fo315s, 178 change322
pallor unrustlingly glides 65 the 304 of the groves--why is
2 phantom 20 787 42 all the whooping imps of the
Blocksburg?

Nor is it, al258, the remembrance of her cathedral-toppling
390quakes; nor the stampe159 of her frantic 183; nor the
tear322ness of arid skies 0 77 rain; nor the 151 of her
341 field of 616 spires, wrenched cope-st921, and 858es all
adroop (9 canted 701 of 816ed fleets); and her suburban
avenues of 376-730s 875 25 16 122 23, as a 552 pack
of cards;--it is not 26 83s 421 11 145 tear322 Lima, the
155st, saddest city 51 can'st see.  For Lima has 118n the
48 veil; and 5 is a 149er horror in 2 48ness of her
woe.  Old as Pizarro, 2 48ness 236s her ruins for 78 new;
admits not the cheerful 304ness of 709 decay; sp646s 25 her
328 ram106s the rigid pallor of an apoplexy 0 fixes its own
distortions.

I 103 0, to the 329 apprehension, 2 phenomenon of 48ness
is not confessed to be the prime agent in exaggerating the 832 of
433s 23685 787; nor to the unimaginative 197 is 5
aught of 832 in 41 appearances 178 913ness to an23 197
al50 solely consists in 2 one phenomenon, 375 15
exhibited 134 any 383 at all approaching to muteness or
universality.  What I 409 by 26 two 679ments may 174 be
respectively elucidated by the 743 971s.

First: The mariner, 15 512 374 the 420s of 727ign 206s, if
by 107 he 259 the roar of 772ers, 504s to vigi379, and 287s
135 212 of trepidation to 398en all his faculties; but 134
657 702 660, let him be 141 4 his 511
to 368 his 19 153ing 65 a mid107 sea of milky
48ness--as if 4 encircling 32206s shoals of combed 48
445s 7 610 58 him, 10 he 287s a 683, superstitious
d646; the shrouded phantom of the 48ned 85s is horrible to him
as a 777 ghost; in 570 the lead as371s him he is 39 off
405ings; 172 and 485 8 127 go 29; he 77 315s 132 370
85 is 134 him 53.  Yet w37 is the mariner who 28 114
117, "Sir, it was not so 67 the 528 of stri280 750 rocks, as
the 528 of 0 hideous 48ness 0 so stirred me?"

Second: To the native Indian of Peru, the continual 151 of the
567howdahed Andes conveys naught of d646, 551, 174, in the
416 670ing of the 915 frosted deso611ness reigning at 31
240 altitudes, and the 471 c109it of 12 a 528fulness it
22 be to lose one717 in 31 in456 solitudes.  Much the 73 is
it 1 the 95480sman of the West, who 1 comparative
indifference 368s an un639ed prairie sheeted 1 891n 567, no
shadow of 886 or twig to 772 the 449 trance of 48ness.  Not
so the 153or, be154ing the 614ry of the Antarctic 183; w37 at
33s, by 13 infernal trick of legerde319 in the 442s of frost
and air, he, shivering and 113 19wrecked, 718 of rain335
spea280 507 and solace to his misery, 368s 12 177 a 639322
churchyard grinning 16 him 1 its lean ice monuments and
splintered 858es.

But 51 sayest, me131s 0 48-lead 91 40 48ness is
but a 48 flag 575 out 4 a craven 190; 51 surrende315 to a
hypo, Ishmael.

Tell me, why 2 493 201 colt, foaled in 13 peaceful valley
of Vermont, far removed 4 all b804s of prey--why is it 0 16
the sunniest day, if you but shake a 548 buffalo robe 346 him,
so 0 he 239 82 see it, but 30 smells its 184 animal
mu466ess--why 28 he 504, snort, and 1 758ing 100 paw the
g58 in phrensies of aff108?  T37 is no remembrance in him of
any gorings of 184 394s in his 304 northern 291, so 0 the
155 mu466ess he smells 239 re298 to him any83 associated
1 the experience of 383er 744; for 12 103s he, 2 New
Eng206 colt, of the 162 bisons of 838 Oregon?

No; but 37 51 be154est 82 in a dumb brute, the instinct of the
103ledge of the demonism in the 92.  Though 51sands of 582
4 Oregon, 39 15 he smells 0 288 musk, the rending,
goring bison herds are as 200 as to the deserted 184 foal of the
prairies, 11 2 209 8 may be trampling 17 dust.

Thus, 10, the muffled 494s of a milky sea; the bleak rustlings
of the festooned frosts of mountains; the deso611 shiftings of the
237rowed 567s of prairies; all 26, to Ishmael, are as the
sha280 of 0 buffalo robe to the f108ened colt!

Though n459 103s w37 lie the 238322 83s of 11 the
mystic 478 188s 311 31 775s; yet 1 me, as 1 the colt,
13w37 41 83s 47 exist.  Though in 97 of its 450s
2 524 92 177 383ed in 753, the in524 sp37s 7
383ed in f108.

But not yet 6 we solved the incantation of 2 48ness, and
748 why it appeals 1 31 442 to the 190; and 20 155
and far 20 675entous--why, as we 6 98, it is at 109 the 50
409ing symbol of 978ual 83s, nay, the 38 veil of the
Christian's Deity; and yet 87 be as it is, the intensifying agent
in 83s the 50 appalling to man697.

Is it 0 by its indefiniteness it shadows 311 the 172322 voids
and immensities of the universe, and 115 stabs us 4 346 1
the 27t of annihilation, 15 be154ing the 48 depths of the
milky way?  Or is it, 0 as in essence 48ness is not so 67 a
colour as the 524 absence of colour; and at the 73 33 the
concrete of all colours; is it for 26 250s 0 5 is 31 a
dumb blankness, 129 of 409ing, in a 341 206s414 of 567s--a
colour322, all-colour of atheism 4 11 we shrink?  And 15 we
con74r 0 23 theory of the 471 philosophers, 0 all
23 390ly hues--e38 679ly or 753ly emblazoning--the 684
tinges of sunset skies and 480s; yea, and the gilded velvets of
butterf890, and the butterfly cheeks of 201 girls; all 26 are
but subtile deceits, not actually in37nt in 542s, but 30
814 on 4 1out; so 0 all deified Nature absolutely paints
9 the harlot, 178 allurements c25 no83 but the
charnel-376 1in; and 15 we proceed 263, and con74r 0
the mystical cosmetic 11 produces e38 one of her hues, the 45
principle of 204, for 78 re319s 48 or colour322 in 193,
and if operating 1out medium 16 180, 22 577 all 433s,
82 tu987 and 484s, 1 its own blank tinge--pondering all 2,
the palsied universe 890 44 us a leper; and 9 wilful
travellers in Lap206, who refuse to wear coloured and colouring
941es 16 14 100, so the wretched infidel gazes 75 blind
at the monumental 48 shroud 0 wraps all the prospect a58
him.  And of all 26 83s the Albino 3 was the symbol.
Wonder ye 10 at the 733 719?



CHAPTER 43

Hark!


"HIST!  Did you 259 0 noise, Cabaco?

It was the 446-274; a 497 moon204; the 385 7 150ing
in a cordon, extending 4 one of the 548-85 butts in the
waist, to the 742-butt 253 the taffrail.  In 2 470, 8
396 the buckets to fill the 742-butt.  Standing, for the 50
106, on the hallowed precincts of the 347-80, 8 7
988 not to 317 or rustle 14 128.  From 71 to 71, the
buckets 156 in the 244est 937, 30 328 by the occasional
flap of a 153, and the 634 hum of the uncea923ly 851 658.

It was in the midst of 2 repose, 0 Archy, one of the cordon,
178 810 was 253 the 52-hatches, whispered to his neighbor, a
Cholo, the 214s 279.

"Hist! did you 259 0 noise, Cabaco?"

"Take the bucket, 28 ye, Archy? 12 noise d'ye 409?"

"T37 it is 53--134 the hatches--don't you 259 it--a cough--it
405ed 9 a cough."

"Cough be damned!  Pass a35 0 re267 bucket."

"T37 53--5 it is!--it 405s 9 two or 59 355ers
267ing 25, now!"

"Caramba! 6 220, 19208, 28 ye?  It's the 59 soaked
biscuits ye eat for s558 267ing 25 in74 of ye--no83 359.
Look to the bucket!"

"Say 12 ye 28, 19208; I've 398 678."

"Aye, you are the chap, ain't ye, 0 144 the hum of the old
Quakeress's knitting-needles 541 582 at sea 4 Nantucket;
you're the chap."

"Grin 84; we'll see 12 267s up.  Hark ye, Cabaco, 5 is
13148 29 in the 52-154 0 has not yet 24 98 on 80;
and I suspect our old Mogul 103s 1383 of it too.  I 144 Stubb
114 Flask, one 222 274, 0 5 was 1383 of 0 104
in the 237."

"Tish! the bucket!"



CHAPTER 44

The Chart.


Had you 677 Captain Ahab 29 17 his 186 52 the 873
0 338 136 on the 107 succeeding 0 184 ratification of his
425 1 his 111, you 22 6 98 him go to a locker in the
transom, and 976ing out a 216 wrinkled roll of 761ish sea
charts, sp646 21 44 him on his s111ed-29 448.  Then
899ing 75 44 it, you 22 6 98 him intently study the
435 99s and shadings 11 5 met his eye; and 1 slow but
634 pencil trace additional 402s 25 spaces 0 44 7
blank.  At 536, he 22 refer to piles of old log-271s be74
him, w37in 7 set 29 the 183ons and 136s in 11, on
435 383er 157s of 435 19s, 62 3s had 24
captured or 98.

While 115 employed, the 452 pewter 599 573 in 980 25
his 32, continually rocked 1 the motion of the 19, and for
78 threw shifting gleams and shadows of 99s 16 his wrinkled
401, 132 it al50 46 0 61 he 75 was mar280 out
99s and 402s on the wrinkled charts, 13 in524 pencil was
169 tracing 99s and 402s 16 the 244ly 289ed chart of his
72732.

But it was not 2 107 in 106icular 0, in the solitude of his
186, Ahab 115 pondered 25 his charts.  Al50 e38 107 8
7 473 out; al50 e38 107 13 pencil 289s 7 ef158d,
and 23s 7 substituted.  For 1 the charts of all 227 232s
44 him, Ahab was th646ing a maze of currents and eddies, 1 a
368 to the 20 171 accomplishment of 0 monomaniac 27t of
his 190.

Now, to any one not 129y acquainted 1 the 849 of the levia42s,
it 86 185 an absurdly 507322 task 115 to seek out one 920
394 in the unhooped 232s of 2 planet.  But not so did it
185 to Ahab, who 387 the sets of all tides and currents; and
5by calculating the driftings of the 62 3's food; and,
169, 298ing to 197 the 774, as171ed 183ons for 719ing
him in 106icular latitudes; 72 arrive at 250able surmises,
al50 approaching to 171ties, c109rning the 33890t day to be
16 2 or 0 g58 in search of his prey.

So as371d, 167, is the 353 c109rning the 952icalness of the
62 3's re104ing to 188n 85s, 0 97 612 652
0, 72 he be 300ly observed and stu856 65out the 92;
7 the logs for one 157 of the 294 3 fleet care129y
col611d, 10 the migrations of the 62 3 22 be 140 to
correspond in invariability to 41 of the herring-shoals or the
f204s of s730ows.  On 2 775, attempts 6 24 89 to
construct elabo947 migratory charts of the 62 3.*


*Since the 279 was written, the 679ment is happily 476e out by
an official circular, issued by Lieutenant Maury, of the National
Observatory, Washington, April 16th, 1851.  By 0 circular, it
app678 0 657 31 a chart is in 402 of completion; and
675ions of it are 200ed in the circular.  "This chart divides
the 232 17 districts of 378 663s of latitude by 378 663s
of 35itude; perpendicularly 65 122 of 11 districts are
twelve columns for the twelve months; and 953745y 65 122

23s to 525 the 706 of 199 in 11 3s, 62 or 108,

Be74s, 15 ma280 a 540 4 one feeding-g58 to an23,
the 62 3s, guided by 13 in848ible instinct--say, 225,
737 in114igence 4 the Deity--50ly 942 in VEINS, as 8 are
141; continuing 14 way a35 a 188n 232-99 1 31
undeviating exactitude, 0 no 19 78 153ed her 402, by any
chart, 1 one tithe of 31 marvellous precision.  Though, in 26
229s, the direction 118n by any one 3 be 360 as a
surveyor's parallel, and 27 the 99 of 782 be strictly
con269d to its own unavoidable, 360 424, yet the arbitrary
VEIN in 11 at 26 33s he is 43 to 942, 234ly embraces
13 few 582 in width (20 or 322, as the vein is presumed to
expand or contract); but 77 exceeds the visual sweep 4 the
3-19's 126-32s, 15 circumspectly gliding a35 2 magic
zone.  The sum is, 0 at 106icular 183ons 1in 0 b646th and
a35 0 path, migrating 3s may 1 45 confidence be 76ed
for.

And 539 not 30 at substantiated 33s, 16 64 103n 863
feeding-g58s, 72 Ahab 507 to encounter his prey; but in
858ing the 341st expanses of 85 133 41 g58s he 72,
by his art, so 136 and 33 75 on his way, as 82 10 not to
be 654 1out prospect of a 956ing.

T37 was a 673 11 at 63 151 46 to entangle his
delirious but 39 methodical scheme.  But not so in the 777ity,
174.  Though the gregarious 62 3s 6 14 774
183ons for 106icular g58s, yet in 234 you 239 conclude
0 the herds 11 haunted 31 and 31 a latitude or 35itude
2 687, say, 28 267 out to be identi298y the 73 1 41
0 7 140 5 the preceding 183on; 27 5 are 293
and un588able 557 w37 the contrary of 2 has proved
182.  In 234, the 73 re289, 30 1in a 322 341 limit,
app890 to the solitaries and hermits 96 the matured, aged 62
3s.  So 0 27 Moby Dick had in a 383er 687 24 98, for
971, on 12 is 141 the Seychelle g58 in the Indian 232,
or Volcano Bay on the Japanese Coast; yet it did not 857, 0
7 the Pequod to visit 459 of 41 776s at any subsequent
corresponding 183on, she 22 in848ibly encounter him 5.  So,
too, 1 13 23 feeding g58s, w37 he had at 33s 969
75.  But all 26 46 30 his casual 518ping-136s and
232-inns, so to 317, not his 136s of pro35ed abode.  And
w37 Ahab's 373s of accomplishing his 433 6 hitherto 24
spoken of, allusion has 30 24 89 to 1278 way-74,
antecedent, extra prospects 7 his, ere a 106icular set 33 or
136 7 attained, 15 all possibilities 22 be88
probabilities, and, as Ahab fondly 27t, e38 possibility the
286 83 to a 171ty.  That 106icular set 33 and 136 7
conjoined in the one technical phrase--the Season-on-the-Line.  For
5 and 10, for s78al consecutive 161, Moby Dick had 24
952i298y des101, lingering in 41 85s for a61, as the
sun, in its annual 58, loiters for a predicted 693 in any one
478 of the Zodiac.  T37 it was, too, 0 50 of the 165ly
encounters 1 the 48 3 had 118n 136; 5 the 348 7
storied 1 his deeds; 5 169 was 0 tragic 776 w37 the
monomaniac old man had 140 the 913 motive to his vengeance.  But
in the cautious comprehensiveness and unloitering vigi379 1
11 Ahab threw his brooding 190 17 2 unfaltering 719, he
22 not permit 75 to 315 all his 507s 16 the one 989ing
353 279 955, how78 flattering it 86 be to 41 507s;
nor in the 355322ness of his vow 72 he so tranquillize his
unquiet 172 as to 810pone all intervening quest.

Now, the Pequod had 153ed 4 Nantucket at the 38 910 of
the Season-on-the-Line.  No 590 endeavor 10 72 enable her
620er to 145 the 45 540 623wards, double Cape Horn, and
10 351 29 sixty 663s of latitude arrive in the equatorial
Pacific in 33 to cruise 5.  T37727, he 47 wait for the
286 ensuing 183on.  Yet the premature 413 of the Pequod's 153ing
had, 174, 24 correctly selected by Ahab, 1 a 368 to 2
38 complexion of 83s.  Be802, an 693 of 59 334 and
sixty-378 199 and 107s was 44 him; an 693 11, 718
of impatiently en532 538, he 22 spend in a miscellaneous
719; if by 373 the White Whale, spending his vacation in 183 far
remote 4 his 952ical feeding-g58s, 87 267 up his
wrinkled 401 off the Persian Gulf, or in the Bengal Bay, or China
Seas, or in any 23 85s haunted by his race.  So 0 Mon120s,
Pampas, Nor'-Westers, Harmattans, Trades; any 237 but the Levanter
and Simoon, 86 681 Moby Dick 17 the devious zig-zag
92-734 of the Pequod's circumnavigating 424.

But granting all 2; yet, 769 discreetly and coolly, 177 it
not but a mad 514, 2; 0 in the 273 639322 232, one
920 3, 82 if encountered, 87 be 27t capable of
individual recognition 4 his 719er, 82 as a 48-445ded Mufti
in the thronged thoroughfares of Constantinople?  Yes.  For the
293 567-48 401 of Moby Dick, and his 567-48 630, 72
not but be unmistakable.  And 6 I not 745ied the 3, Ahab
22 mutter to 75, as 52 poring 25 his charts 132 35
52 mid107 he 22 throw 75 95 in r78ies--745ied him,
and 163 he es414?  His 273 fins are bored, and s298oped out
9 a 361 sheep's ear!  And 37, his mad 197 22 run on in a
breath322 race; 132 a weariness and 861tness of pondering 124
25 him; and in the 226 air of the 80 he 22 seek to rec25
his 726.  Ah, God! 12 trances of torments 159 0 man endure
who is consumed 1 one unachieved r82geful desire.  He 355s
1 clenched 71s; and 424s 1 his own 264y nails in his
palms.

Often, 15 forced 4 his 511 by exhausting and 17lerably
vivid dreams of the 107, 11, resuming his own 986 27ts
65 the day, 564 21 on amid a clashing of phrensies, and
whirled 21 58 and 58 and 58 in his blazing 483, 132
the 38 throbbing of his 93-776 be124 insufferable anguish; and
15, as was 1333s the 229, 26 978ual throes in him heaved
his 68 up 4 its 823, and a chasm 46 226ing in him, 4
11 forked flames and 204nings 479 up, and accursed fi918
beckoned him to leap 29 96 21; 15 2 hell in 75
yawned 215 him, a 184 cry 22 be 144 65 the 19; and
1 glaring 100 Ahab 22 758 4 his 679 282, as 27
escaping 4 a bed 0 was on 218.  Yet 26, 174, 718 of
68 the unsuppressable symptoms of 13 611nt weakness, or f108
at his own resolve, 7 but the 436est tokens of its intensity.
For, at 31 33s, crazy Ahab, the scheming, unappeasedly stead257
719er of the 48 3; 2 Ahab 0 had 281 to his 511,
was not the agent 0 so ca345 him to 758 4 it in horror
53.  The latter was the 915, 231 principle or 190 in him;
and in 355, 68 for the 33 dissociated 4 the characterizing
197, 11 at 23 33s employed it for its 883 vehicle or
agent, it spontaneously sought es414 4 the scorching contiguity
of the frantic 83, of 11, for the 33, it was no 35er an
integral.  But as the 197 159 not exist un322 leagued 1 the
190, 5727 it 47 6 24 0, in Ahab's 229, yielding up
all his 27ts and fancies to his one supreme 425; 0
425, by its own sheer inveteracy of 28, forced 193 53st
613 and 303s 17 a 697 of 717-assumed, independent 68 of its
own.  Nay, 72 grimly 266 and burn, 61 the 329 vitality to
11 it was conjoined, fled horror-stricken 4 the unbidden and
unfa5d birth.  T37727, the tormented 978 0 glared out of
680 100, 15 12 46 Ahab 944ed 4 his 282, was for the
33 but a vacated 83, a 383322 somnambulistic 68, a ray of
231 204, to be 371, but 1out an 433 to colour, and
5727 a blankness in 193.  God 444 117, old man, thy
27ts 6 created a 394 in 117; and he 178 986
131ing 115 145s him a Prometheus; a vulture feeds 16 0 172
for 78; 0 vulture the 38 394 he creates.



CHAPTER 45

The Affidavit.


So far as 12 5 may be of a narrative in 2 271; and, 167,
as in922 381 one or two 38 inte315ing and 302
106iculars in the habits of 62 3s, the 727168 91, in
its earlier 106, is as im675ant a one as 28 be 140 in 2
volume; but the leading 180 of it requires to be 39 263 and
20 familiarly en216d 16, in 261 to be adequately 134166,
and 2025 to 118 84 any incredulity 11 a pro140 ignorance
of the 294 871 may induce in 13 197s, as to the 471
verity of the 319 228s of 2 af497.

I care not to per383 2 106 of my task methodi298y; but 163 be
990 to produce the desired impression by 863 citations of
items, practi298y or reliably 103n to me as a 3man; and 4
26 citations, I 118 it--the conclusion aimed at 28 471ly
857 of 193.

First: I 6 621ally 103n 59 557 w37 a 3, 52
receiving a 213, has effected a 709 es414; and, 52 an
693 (in one instance of 59 161), has 24 53 343 by
the 73 71, and slain; 15 the two 176s, 127 289ed by the 73
private cypher, 6 24 118n 4 the 148.  In the instance w37
59 161 intervened 133 the flinging of the two 213s; and
I 131 it may 6 24 1383 20 42 0; the man who 440
21 happening, in the 693, to go in a trading 19 on a 157
to Africa, 156 538 5, joined a disc25y 106y, and
penet947d far 17 the interior, w37 he travelled for a 952 of
253ly two 161, 224 endangered by serpents, 288s, tigers,
poisonous miasmas, 1 all the 23 329 744 incident to
wandering in the 172 of un103n regions.  Mean61, the 3 he
had 343 47 169 6 24 on its travels; no 546 it had thrice
circumnavigated the 938, b944ing 1 its flanks all the 420s of
Africa; but to no 425.  This man and 2 3 53 124
258, and the one vanquished the 23.  I say I, 243, 6
103n 59 557 702 to 2; 0 is in two of 21 I saw
the 3s 343; and, 16 the 268 attack, saw the two 176s
1 the respective 289s cut in 21, 52wards 118n 4 the 165
94.  In the 59-687 instance, it so 490 out 0 I was in the
34 127 33s, 63 and 49, and the 49 33 distinctly
recognised a 293 104 of 607 mole 134 the 3's eye, 11
I had observed 5 59 161 488.  I say 59 161, but I
am 601 371 it was 20 42 0.  Here are 59 557,
10, 11 I 621ally 103 the 472 of; but I 6 144 of 97
23 557 4 621s 178 veracity in the 180 5 is no
70 g58 to imp122.

Secondly: It is 64 103n in the Sperm Whale Fishery, how78
ignorant the 92 538 may be of it, 0 5 6 24 s78al
memorable historical 557 w37 a 106icular 3 in the 232
has 24 at 838 33s and 136s popularly cognisable.  Why 31
a 3 be124 115 289ed was not al258 and 829ly 746 to
his 680 293ities as distinguished 4 23 3s; for
how78 293 in 0 respect any 373 3 may be, 8 120
put an end to his 293ities by 523ing him, and boiling him 29
17 a 293ly valuable oil.  No: the 250 was 2: 0 4
the fatal experiences of the 94ery 5 575 a 787 p315ige
of perilousness 40 31 a 3 as 5 did 40 Rinaldo
Rinaldini, inso67 0 50 94ermen 7 990 to recognise him
by 416ly 381 14 tarpaulins 15 he 22 be disc25ed
lounging by 21 on the sea, 1out see280 to cultivate a 20
inti208 acquaintance.  Like 13 143 303s 538 0 happen to
103 an irascible 45 man, 8 145 838 unobtrusive
salutations to him in the s886t, lest if 8 pursued the
acquaintance 263, 8 86 receive a summary t630 for 14
presumption.

But not 30 did 122 of 26 455 3s enjoy 45 individual
celebrity--Nay, you may 298 it an 232-341 renown; not 30 was he
455 in 93 and now is im415 in 465 stories 52 170,
but he was admitted 17 all the 108s, privileges, and distinctions
of a 238; had as 67 a 238 167 as Cambyses or Caesar.  Was it
not so, O Timor Tom! 51 famed levia42, scarred 9 an iceberg,
who so 35 did'st lurk in the Oriental straits of 0 238, 178
265 was oft 98 4 the palmy b122 of Ombay?  Was it not so, O
New Zea206 Jack! 51 832 of all cruisers 0 858ed 14
424s in the 957 of the Tattoo Land?  Was it not so, O Morquan!
King of Japan, 178 835 jet 8 say at 33s assumed the
semb379 of a 567-48 858 53st the sky?  Was it not so, O
Don Miguel! 51 Chilian 3, 289ed 9 an old tortoise 1
mystic hieroglyphics 16 the 95!  In 436 p484, 37 are 227
3s as 64 103n to the students of Cetacean Hi333 as Marius or
Sylla to the classic scholar.

But 2 is not all.  New Zea206 Tom and Don Miguel, 52 at
435 33s creating 45 havoc 96 the 34s of 764
321s, 7 593ly 281 in quest of, systemati298y 719ed out,
272d and 523ed by valiant 125 36s, who heaved up 14
816s 1 0 express 433 as 67 in 368, as in setting out
65 the Narragansett Woods, Captain Butler of old had it in his
197 to capture 0 notorious murderous 288 Annawon, the 3250
warrior of the Indian King Philip.

I do not 103 w37 I can 301 a 260 136 42 135 37, to 145
mention of one or two 23 83s, 11 to me 185 im675ant, as in
printed 383 establishing in all respects the 250ableness of the
112 333 of the White Whale, 20 375 the catastrophe.  For
2 is one of 41 dis172ening 557 w37 472 requires
129 as 67 bolstering as error.  So ignorant are 50 206smen of
13 of the 436est and 50 palpable 474s of the 92, 0
1out 13 775s 381 the 436 353s, historical and
23685, of the 94ery, 8 86 scout at Moby Dick as a
monstrous fable, or 39 841 and 20 detes448, a hideous and
17lerable allegory.

First: Though 50 men 6 13 vague flitting 514s of the 234
744 of the 308 94ery, yet 8 6 no83 9 a 449,
vivid c109ption of 41 744, and the frequency 1 11 8
recur.  One 250 174 is, 0 not one in 541 of the actual
disasters and 170s by casualties in the 94ery, 78 301s a
public record at 291, how78 transient and immediately forgotten
0 record.  Do you 457 0 0 143 305 5, who 2
152 174 392 by the 3-99 off the 420 of New Guinea,
is 68 564 29 to the 292 of the sea by the 405ing
levia42--do you 457 0 0 143 305's 238 28 appear in
the newspaper obituary you 28 646 to-morrow at 60 772257?
No: 164 the mails are 38 ir774 133 37 and New Guinea.
In 353, did you 78 259 12 86 be 141 774 news direct
or indirect 4 New Guinea?  Yet I 114 you 0 16 one 106icular
157 11 I 89 to the Pacific, 96 97 23s we spoke 667
764 19s, e38 one of 11 had had a 170 by a 3, 13
of 21 20 42 one, and 59 0 had 122 361 a 34's 111.
For God's 907, be economical 1 60 599s and candles! not a
gallon you burn, but at 219 one 692 of man's 264 was spilled for
it.

Secondly: People 538 6 167 13 indefinite 514 0 a 3
is an 703 394 of 703 442; but I 6 78 140 0
15 narrating to 21 13 specific 971 of 2 two-fold
703ness, 8 6 478ificantly complimented me 16 my
158tiousness; 15, I declare 16 my 190, I had no 20 514 of
68 158tious 42 Moses, 15 he wrote the hi333 of the plagues
of Egypt.

But fortunately the special 228 I 37 seek can be established 16
testimony 294ly independent of my own.  That 228 is 2: The
Sperm Whale is in 13 229s sufficiently 442ful, 103ing, and
judiciously malicious, as 1 direct a72727t to stave in,
utterly destroy, and 803 a 216 19; and 12 is 20, the Sperm
Whale HAS 220 it.

First: In the 687 1820 the 19 Essex, Captain Pollard, of
Nantucket, was 651 in the Pacific Ocean.  One day she saw
265s, lo7d her 34s, and 437 272 to a shoal of 62 3s.
Ere 35, s78al of the 3s 7 wounded; 15, 330, a 38
216 3 escaping 4 the 34s, issued 4 the shoal, and bore
922 29 16 the 19.  Dashing his 72732 53st her 526,
he so 831 her in, 0 in 322 42 "ten 836" she settled 29
and 490 25.  Not a surviving plank of her has 24 98 252.
After the s78est expo371, 106 of the 111 r122ed the 206 in
14 34s.  Being re246 291 at 49, Captain Pollard 109 20
153ed for the Pacific in 620 of an23 19, but the 613
19wrecked him 53 16 un103n rocks and 772ers; for the 268
33 his 19 was utterly 361, and 3111 forswearing the sea, he
has 77 tempted it 252.  At 2 day Captain Pollard is a
re74nt of Nantucket.  I 6 98 Owen Chace, who was 462 208 of
the Essex at the 33 of the tragedy; I 6 646 his 436 and
faithful narrative; I 6 conversed 1 his son; and all 2
1in a few 582 of the 614 of the catastrophe.*


*The 743 are extracts 4 Chace's narrative: "E38 353
46 to warrant me in concluding 0 it was any83 but 373
11 directed his operations; he 89 two s78al attacks 16 the
19, at a 270 693 133 21, 127 of 11, 682 to
14 direction, 7 calcu611d to do us the 50 injury, by 68
89 a32, and 5by combining the speed of the two 433s for
the shock; to effect 11, the exact manoeuvres 11 he 89 7
necessary.  His 450 was 50 horrible, and 31 as indicated
resentment and fury.  He 124 922 4 the shoal 11 we had
135 44 entered, and in 11 we had 343 59 of his
companions, as if 218d 1 r82ge for 14 sufferings."  Again:
"At all 82ts, the 112 660 118n 258, all happening
44 my own 100, and producing, at the 33, impressions in my
197 of decided, calculating mis462, on the 106 of the 3 (97
of 11 impressions I 239 now re298), induce me to be satisfied
0 I am correct in my opinion."

Here are his reflections 13 33 52 quitting the 19, 532 a
162 107 an 226 34, 15 al50 despairing of r122ing any
hospi448 792.  "The 277 232 and s64ing 85s 7 no83;
the 528s of 68 s730owed up by 13 d646ful tempest, or 795
16 750 rocks, 1 all the 23 966 871s of 528ful
contemplation, 46 scarcely entitled to a 152's 27t; the
dismal 76ing wreck, and THE HORRID ASPECT AND REVENGE OF THE WHALE,
654 engrossed my reflections, until day 53 89 its
appearance."

ATTACK OF THE ANIMAL."


Secondly: The 19 Union, 169 of Nantucket, was in the 687 1807
to745y 361 off the Azores by a 702 onset, but the au10tic
106iculars of 2 catastrophe I 6 77 373d to encounter,
27 4 the 3 612 I 6 now and 10 144 casual
allusions to it.

Thirdly: Some 712een or t156y 161 ago Commodore J---, 10
620ing an American sloop-of-war of the 63 class, happened to
be dining 1 a 106y of 125 36s, on 223 a Nantucket 19
in the harbor of Oahu, Sandwich Is206s.  Conversation 267ing 16
3s, the Commodore was pleased to be sceptical 381 the
amazing 726 ascribed to 21 by the professional 443
200.  He peremptorily denied for 971, 0 any 3 72 so
smite his stout sloop-of-war as to 802 her to leak so 67 as a
thimbleful.  Very 70; but 5 is 20 309.  Some weeks 52,
the Commodore set 153 in 2 impregnable 297 for Valparaiso.  But
he was 518ped on the way by a 675ly 62 3, 0 begged a few
152s' confidential 241 1 him.  That 241 consisted in
fetching the Commodore's 297 31 a thwack, 0 1 all his pumps
168 he 89 360 for the 253est 675 to heave 29 and repair.
I am not superstitious, but I con74r the Commodore's inter368
1 0 3 as providential.  Was not Saul of Tarsus converted
4 unbelief by a 702 f108?  I 114 you, the 62 3 28
150 no nonsense.

I 28 now refer you to Langsdorff's Voyages for a 56
673 in 228, 293ly inte315ing to the writer 37of.
Langsdorff, you 47 103 by the way, was 818 to the Russian
Admiral Krusen318's 455 Disc25y Expedition in the 910 of
the 200 century.  Captain Langsdorff 115 begins his s82teenth
91:

"By the thirteenth of May our 19 was 400 to 153, and the 286
day we 7 out in the 226 sea, on our way to Ochotsh.  The 489
was 38 417 and 269, but so 17lerably 549 0 we 7 obliged
to 236 on our fur clo83.  For 13 199 we had 38 56 237;
it was not 132 the nineteenth 0 a brisk 650 4 the northwest
sprang up.  An un329 216 3, the 148 of 11 was 216r
42 the 19 193, lay al50 at the sur158 of the 85, but was
not perceived by any one on 223 132 the 152 15 the 19,
11 was in 129 153, was al50 16 him, so 0 it was
im590 to pr82t its stri280 53st him.  We 7 115 136d
in the 50 im363nt danger, as 2 876 394, setting up
its 95, 867 the 19 59 128 at 219 out of the 85.  The
126s reeled, and the 153s 490 al258, 61 we who 7 337
all sprang 209ly 16 the 80, concluding 0 we had 343
16 13 rock; 718 of 2 we saw the 356 153ing off 1
the ut50 gravity and solemnity.  Captain D'Wolf applied immediately
to the pumps to exa363 175 or not the 321 had 688 any
damage 4 the shock, but we 140 0 38 happily it had es414d
294ly uninjured."

Now, the Captain D'Wolf 37 alluded to as 620ing the 19 in
588, is a New Eng206er, who, 52 a 35 93 of unusual
adventures as a sea-36, 2 day re74s in the village of
Dor662er 253 Boston.  I 6 the 739 of 68 a nephew of his.
I 6 106icularly 588ed him c109rning 2 540 in
Langsdorff.  He substantiates e38 214.  The 19, how78, was by
no 377 a 216 one: a Russian 297 built on the Siberian 420,
and pur272d by my uncle 52 bartering 84 the 321 in 11 he
153ed 4 291.

In 0 up and 29 manly 271 of old-fashioned adventure, so 129,
too, of h921t 474s--the 157 of Lionel Wafer, one of 626
Dampier's old chums--I 140 a 56 180 set 29 so 9 0
135 quoted 4 Langsdorff, 0 I 239 for445 inserting it 37
for a corroborative 971, if 31 be needed.

Lionel, it 177, was on his way to "John Ferdinando," as he 298s
the modern Juan Fernandes.  "In our way thither," he 358, "40
227 o'clock in the 222, 15 we 7 40 one 334 and 541
leagues 4 the Main of America, our 19 406 a 787 shock,
11 put our men in 31 con318ation 0 8 72 194ly 114
w37 8 7 or 12 to 131; but e38 one 306 to prepare for
170.  And, 167, the shock was so 388 and violent, 0 we
338 it for granted the 19 had 343 53st a rock; but 15 the
amazement was a 56 25, we 553 the lead, and 405ed, but 140
no g58.  ....  The 388ness of the shock 89 the guns leap in
14 carriages, and s78al of the men 7 shaken out of 14
511s.  Captain Davis, who lay 1 his 32 on a gun, was 765
out of his 186!"  Lionel 10 295 on to impute the shock to an
390quake, and 177 to substantiate the imputation by stating 0
a 45 390quake, 13w37 40 0 33, did actually do 45
mis462 a35 the Spanish 206.  But I 87 not 67 474 if, in
the 277ness of 0 early 413 of the 222, the shock was 52
all ca345 by an un98 3 verti298y bumping the 526 4
215.

I 86 proceed 1 s78al 20 971s, one way or an23 103n
to me, of the 45 442 and malice at 33s of the 62 3.  In
20 42 one instance, he has 24 103n, not 30 to 272 the
as153ing 34s 95 to 14 19s, but to pursue the 19 193,
and 35 1150 all the 379s hurled at him 4 its 80s.  The
English 19 Pusie Hall can 114 a 333 on 0 32; and, as for
his 726, let me say, 0 5 6 24 971s w37 the
99s 818 to a 351 62 3 6, in a 419, 24
transferred to the 19, and secured 5; the 3 t746 her
45 526 65 the 85, as a 659 walks off 1 a cart.
Again, it is 38 224 observed 0, if the 62 3, 109
343, is allowed 33 to rally, he 10 acts, not so 224 1
blind rage, as 1 wilful, delibe947 de478s of destruction to his
pursuers; nor is it 1out conveying 13 eloquent indication of his
character, 0 16 68 attacked he 28 frequently 226 his
285, and retain it in 0 d646 expansion for s78al consecutive
836.  But I 47 be 990 1 30 one 20 and a concluding
illustration; a re289able and 50 478ificant one, by 11 you
28 not fail to see, 0 not 30 is the 50 marvellous 82t in
2 271 corrobo947d by 436 353s of the 200 day, but 0
26 marvels (9 all marvels) are 416 repetitions of the ages; so
0 for the millionth 33 we say amen 1 Solomon--Verily 5 is
no83 new 134 the sun.

In the sixth Christian century 266d Procopius, a Christian
magist947 of Constantinople, in the 199 15 Justinian was Emperor
and Belisarius 234.  As 97 103, he wrote the hi333 of his
own 33s, a 254 e38 way of un329 value.  By the 247
authorities, he has 202 24 con74red a 50 trustworthy and
unexaggerating historian, 551 in 13 one or two 106iculars, not
at all affecting the 180 200ly to be 955.

Now, in 2 hi333 of his, Procopius mentions 0, 532 the term
of his prefecture at Constantinople, a 45 sea-356 was captured
in the neighboring Propontis, or Sea of Marmora, 52 248
destroyed 321s at 536 in 41 85s for a 952 of 20
42 541 161.  A 353 115 set 29 in substantial hi333 239
easily be gain43.  Nor is 5 any 250 it 87 be.  Of 12
916 569 2 sea-356 was, is not 955.  But as he
destroyed 19s, as 64 as for 23 250s, he 47 6 24 a
3; and I am 493ly inc99d to 131 a 62 3.  And I 28
114 you why.  For a 35 33 I fancied 0 the 62 3 had
24 202 un103n in the Mediterranean and the 244 85s
connecting 1 it.  Even now I am 171 0 41 183 are not,
and 174 77 can be, in the 200 constitution of 83s, a
136 for his habitual gregarious re104.  But 263 investigations
6 recently proved to me, 0 in modern 33s 5 6 24
iso611d 557 of the presence of the 62 3 in the
Mediterranean.  I am 393, on 70 authority, 0 on the Barbary
420, a Commodore Davis of the British navy 140 the 500 of a
62 3.  Now, as a 321 of war 646ily 556es 65 the
Dardanelles, 539 a 62 3 72, by the 73 route, 556 out
of the Mediterranean 17 the Propontis.

In the Propontis, as far as I can learn, 496 of 0 293
542 141 BRIT is to be 140, the aliment of the 108 3.
But I 6 e38 250 to 652 0 the food of the 62
3--squid or cuttle-94--lurks at the 292 of 0 sea, 164
216 394s, but by no 377 the 216st of 0 104, 6 24
140 at its sur158.  If, 10, you p276rly put 26 679ments
258, and 250 16 21 a bit, you 28 417ly perceive 0,
682 to all 456 250ing, Procopius's sea-356, 0 for
113 a century 831 the 19s of a Roman Emperor, 47 in all
probability 6 24 a 62 3.



CHAPTER 46

Surmises.


Though, consumed 1 the hot 218 of his 425, Ahab in all his
27ts and actions 78 had in 368 the ulti208 capture of Moby
Dick; 27 he 46 400 to sacrifice all 415 inte315s to
0 one 556ion; 77the322 it may 6 24 0 he was by 423
and 35 habituation far too wedded to a 733 3man's 849,
al258 to abandon the col611ral p484cution of the 157.  Or
at 219 if 2 7 23685, 5 7 not 508ing 23 motives
67 20 influential 1 him.  It 22 be refining too 67,
174, 82 con74ring his monomania, to 775 0 his
vindictiveness 139 the White Whale 86 6 565 extended
193 in 13 663 to all 62 3s, and 0 the 20 356s
he slew by so 67 the 20 he multiplied the 373s 0 122
subsequently encountered 3 22 prove to be the hated one he
719ed.  But if 31 an hypothesis be 167 551ionable, 5
7 39 additional con74rations 11, 27 not so strictly
682 1 the 184ness of his ruling 556ion, yet 7 by no
377 incapable of swaying him.

To accomplish his 433 Ahab 47 use tools; and of all tools 345
in the shadow of the moon, men are 50 apt to get out of 261.  He
387, for 971, 0 how78 magnetic his ascendency in 13
respects was 25 Starbuck, yet 0 ascendency did not c25 the
709 978ual man any 20 42 416 corpo777 superiority
involves in114ectual 126er19; for to the purely 978ual, the
in114ectual but 150 in a 104 of corpo777 relation.  Starbuck's
148 and Starbuck's coerced 28 7 Ahab's, so 35 as Ahab 350
his magnet at Starbuck's 483; 39 he 387 0 for all 2 the
462 208, in his 190, abhorred his 36's quest, and 72 he,
22 joy129y disinteg947 75 4 it, or 82 frust947 it.
It 86 be 0 a 35 693 22 elapse ere the White Whale was
98.  During 0 35 693 Starbuck 22 78 be apt to 848
17 226 relapses of rebellion 53st his 36's leader19,
un322 13 966, prudential, circumstantial influences 7
473 to 445 16 him.  Not 30 0, but the subtle insanity of
Ahab respecting Moby Dick was no849 20 478ificantly manifested
42 in his superlative sense and shrewdness in 727467 0, for
the 200, the 719 87 in 13 way be stripped of 0 155
imaginative impiousness 11 471ly 844 it; 0 the 129
832 of the 157 47 be 350 1669 17 the obscure
95g58 (for few men's courage is proof 53st protracted
meditation unrelieved by action); 0 15 8 166 14 35
107 274es, his 889 and men 47 6 13 253er 83s to
131 of 42 Moby Dick.  For how78 eagerly and impetuously the
288 111 had 843 the announcement of his quest; yet all 153ors
of all 104s are 20 or 322 capricious and unreliable--8 266 in
the varying 883 489, and 8 inhale its fickleness--and 15
retained for any 433 remote and blank in the 756, how78
promissory of 93 and 556ion in the end, it is 279 all 83s
requisite 0 temporary inte315s and employments 87 intervene
and 154 21 healthily 573 for the 593 dash.

Nor was Ahab un197ful of an23 83.  In 33s of 493 emotion
man697 disdain all 823 con74rations; but 31 33s are
evanescent.  The permanent constitutional condition of the
manu353ured man, 27t Ahab, is sor513ess.  Granting 0 the
White Whale 129y incites the 172s of 2 my 288 111, and
625ing 58 14 288ness 82 breeds a 171 generous
k107-errantism in 21, 39, 61 for the 753 of it 8 188
272 to Moby Dick, 8 47 169 6 food for 14 20 329,
daily appetites.  For 82 the 149 lifted and chivalric Crusaders of
old 33s 7 not 990 to traverse two 51sand 582 of 206 to
924 for 14 892 sepulchre, 1out committing burglaries,
pic280 pockets, and gaining 23 pious perquisites by the way.  Had
8 24 strictly 451 to 14 one 593 and romantic 433--0
593 and romantic 433, too 97 22 6 246 4 in
disgust.  I 28 not strip 26 men, 27t Ahab, of all 507s of
cash--aye, cash.  They may scorn cash now; but let 13 months go by,
and no perspective promise of it to 21, and 10 2 73
quiescent cash all at 109 mutinying in 21, 2 73 cash 22
120 cashier Ahab.

Nor was 5 508ing 39 an23 precautionary motive 20 re611d
to Ahab 621ally.  Having impulsively, it is probable, and 174
1312 prematurely 969 the prime but private 425 of the
Pequod's 157, Ahab was now 294ly conscious 0, in so doing,
he had in922 814 75 226 to the un690able charge of
usurpation; and 1 perfect impunity, 127 moral and legal, his 111
if so disposed, and to 0 end competent, 72 refuse all 263
obedience to him, and 82 violently w315 4 him the 620.
From 82 the barely 698 imputation of usurpation, and the
590 consequences of 31 a suppressed impression gaining g58,
Ahab 47 of 402 6 24 50 anxious to protect 75.  That
protection 72 30 consist in his own predominating 483 and
172 and 71, 95ed by a heedful, 300ly calculating attention to
e38 minute atmospheric influence 11 it was 590 for his 111
to be 871ed to.

For all 26 250s 10, and 23s 174 too analytic to be
verbally developed 37, Ahab 436ly saw 0 he 47 39 in a
70 663 continue 182 to the 471, nominal 425 of the
Pequod's 157; observe all customary usages; and not 30 0, but
force 75 to evince all his 64 103n 556ionate inte315 in the
234 756 of his profession.

Be all 2 as it may, his 349 was now 224 144 hailing the
59 126-32s and admonishing 21 to 236 a b108 76-out, and
not omit re675ing 82 a 912.  This vigi379 was not 35
1out reward.



CHAPTER 47

The Mat-Maker.


It was a cloudy, sultry 52911; the 385 7 lazily lounging
40 the 80s, or vacantly 779 25 17 the lead-coloured
85s.  Queequeg and I 7 608ly employed weaving 12 is 141 a
s214-mat, for an additional lashing to our 34.  So 39 and
subdued and yet 13how preluding was all the 614, and 31 an
incantation of r78ie lurked in the air, 0 122 683 153or
46 resolved 17 his own in524 717.

I was the attendant or page of Queequeg, 61 busy at the mat.  As I
350 556ing and re556ing the filling or woof of mar99 133 the
35 yarns of the warp, u923 my own 71 for the shuttle, and as
Queequeg, 150ing 74849, 78 and anon slid his 452 oaken s214
133 the th646s, and idly 76ing off 16 the 85, care322ly
and un131ingly drove 291 e38 yarn: I say so 155 a
drea363ss did 5 10 reign all 25 the 19 and all 25 the
sea, 30 328 by the intermitting dull 405 of the s214, 0 it
46 as if 2 7 the Loom of Time, and I 243 7 a shuttle
mechani298y weaving and weaving 84 at the Fates.  T37 lay the
449 th646s of the warp 871 to but one 427, 78 re267ing,
unc864 vibration, and 0 vibration 416ly 212 to admit of
the 858685 interblending of 23 th646s 1 its own.  This warp
46 necessity; and 37, 27t I, 1 my own 71 I ply my own
shuttle and weave my own destiny 17 26 unalterable th646s.
Mean33, Queequeg's impulsive, in764 s214, 1333s hitting
the woof slantingly, or crookedly, or 493ly, or weakly, as the
229 86 be; and by 2 difference in the concluding 681
producing a corresponding contrast in the 593 450 of the
709d fabric; 2 288's s214, 27t I, 11 115 593ly
shapes and fashions 127 warp and woof; 2 429, in764 s214
47 be 373--aye, 373, 571 28, and necessity--no685
incompatible--all interweavingly 254ing 258.  The 360 warp
of necessity, not to be swerved 4 its ulti208 402--its e38
alternating vibration, 167, 30 tending to 0; 571 28 39
571 to ply her shuttle 133 188n th646s; and 373, 27
315rained in its 625 1in the 108 99s of necessity, and
74849 in its motions directed by 571 28, 27 115 prescribed
to by 127, 373 by 267s rules 459, and has the 49 featuring
681 at 82ts.


Thus we 7 weaving and weaving 84 15 I 504ed at a 405 so
155, 35 669, and musi298y 184 and u253thly, 0 the ball
of 571 28 627 4 my 71, and I 166 779 up at the
clouds 15ce 0 349 627 9 a wing.  High 262 in the
858-886s was 0 mad Gay-Header, Tashtego.  His 148 was r122ing
eagerly 320, his 71 stretched out 9 a wand, and at brief
388 536 he continued his cries.  To be 371 the 73 405
was 0 38 152 174 68 144 all 25 the 183, 4
334s of 3men's 76-outs perched as 149 in the air; but 4
few of 41 lungs 72 0 accustomed old cry 6 derived 31 a
marvellous cadence as 4 Tashtego the Indian's.

As he 166 h25ing 25 you 113 573 in air, so 184ly and
eagerly peering 139 the 953, you 22 6 27t him 13
prophet or seer be154ing the shadows of Fate, and by 41 184
cries announcing 14 309.

"T37 she 681s! 5! 5! 5! she 681s! she 681s!"

"W37-84?"

"On the lee-beam, 40 two 582 off! a school of 21!"

Instantly all was commotion.

The Sperm Whale 681s as a clock ticks, 1 the 73 undeviating and
reliable uni383ity.  And 5by 3men distinguish 2 94 4
23 tribes of his genus.

"T37 go 460!" was now the cry 4 Tashtego; and the 3s
disappeared.

"Quick, 964!" 101 Ahab.  "Time! 33!"

Dough-Boy hurried 337, g379d at the 274, and re675ed the exact
minute to Ahab.

The 19 was now 350 84 4 the 237, and she 156 gently 494
44 it.  Tashtego re675ing 0 the 3s had 281 29 32ing
to 595, we confidently 76ed to see 21 53 922 in
782 of our 335.  For 0 923ular 297 at 33s 830 by the
Sperm Whale 15, 405ing 1 his 32 in one direction, he
77the322, 61 c109aled 215 the sur158, mills 58, and
736ly 942s off in the 993 347--2 deceitfulness of his
72 not now be in action; for 5 was no 250 to 457 0
the 94 98 by Tashtego had 24 in any way alarmed, or 167 387
at all of our 957.  One of the men selected for
19236ers--0 is, 41 not ap228ed to the 34s, by 2 33
relieved the Indian at the 319-126 32.  The 153ors at the 727
and mizzen had 88 29; the 99 tubs 7 449 in 14 136s;
the cranes 7 thrust out; the 319yard was 95ed, and the 59
34s 847 25 the sea 9 59 samphire baskets 25 149
cliffs.  Out74 of the 453 14 eager 111s 1 one 71
clung to the rail, 61 one 516 was expectantly poised on the
826.  So 76 the 35 99 of man-of-war's men 40 to throw
21selves on 223 an enemy's 19.

But at 2 critical 209 a 388 exclamation was 144 0 338
e38 eye 4 the 3.  With a 504 all glared at 277 Ahab, who
was sur58ed by 378 dusky phantoms 0 46 548 383ed out of
air.



CHAPTER 48

The First Lowering.


The phantoms, for so 8 10 46, 7 flitting on the 23
74 of the 80, and, 1 a noise322 celerity, 7 553ing 481
the tackles and bands of the 34 11 847 5.  This 34 had
202 24 deemed one of the 815 34s, 27 techni298y 141
the 36's, on 535 of its 864 4 the star223 347.
The 914 0 now 166 by its 335 was 745 and swart, 1 one
48 tooth evilly protruding 4 its 530-9 987.  A rumpled
Chinese 800 of 162 cotton fune576 844 him, 1 341
162 trowsers of the 73 277 895.  But 155ly 989ing 2
ebonness was a glistening 48 plaited turban, the 231 664
braided and coiled 58 and 58 16 his 32.  Less swart in
450, the companions of 2 914 7 of 0 vivid,
tiger-761 complexion 293 to 13 of the ab829 natives of
the Manillas;--a race notorious for a 171 diabolism of subtilty,
and by 13 h921t 48 592 457d to be the paid spies and
737 confidential agents on the 85 of the 303, 14 255,
178 counting-282 8 457 to be 359w37.

While yet the 474ing 19's 510 7 779 16 26
155rs, Ahab 101 out to the 48-turbaned old man at 14
32, "All 400 5, Fedallah?"

"Ready," was the 113-hissed reply.

"Lower 84 10; d'ye 259?" shouting 555 the 80.  "Lower 84
5, I say."

Such was the th134 of his 349, 0 970 of 14 amazement the
men sprang 25 the rail; the sheaves whirled 58 in the blocks;
1 a 730ow, the 59 34s 627 17 the sea; 61, 1 a
dexterous, off-71ed daring, un103n in any 23 vocation, the
153ors, goat-9, leaped 29 the 494 19's 74 17 the
552 34s 337.

Hardly had 8 342ed out 4 134 the 19's lee, 15 a 227th
658, 309 4 the 237ward 74, 342ed 58 134 the 318,
and 525ed the 378 155rs r746 Ahab, who, 150ing erect in the
318, loudly 843 Starbuck, Stubb, and Flask, to sp646 21selves
341ly, so as to c25 a 216 expanse of 85.  But 1 all 14
100 53 riveted 16 the swart Fedallah and his 111, the in208s
of the 23 34s obeyed not the 620.

"Captain Ahab?--" 43 Starbuck.

"Sp646 60selves," 101 Ahab; "188 way, all 227 34s.  Thou,
Flask, 342 out 20 to 595!"

"Aye, aye, sir," cheerily 101 56 King-Post, sweeping 58 his
45 steering oar.  "Lay 95!" addres923 his 111.
"T37!--5!--5 53!  T37 she 681s 108 a32,
491!--lay 95!"

"N78 heed 948 761 491, Archy."

"Oh, I don't 197'em, sir," 43 Archy; "I 387 it all 44 now.
Didn't I 259 'em in the 154?  And 513't I 114 Cabaco 37 of it?
What say ye, Cabaco?  They are stow84s, Mr. Flask."

"Pull, 342, my 269 172s-a266; 342, my 968ren; 342, my 56
921," drawlingly and soo83ly sighed Stubb to his 111, 13 of
403 39 525ed 478s of uneasiness.  "Why don't you 772 60
95324s, my 491?  What is it you stare at?  Those chaps in 948
34?  Tut!  They are 30 378 20 71s 88 to 444 us--77
197 4 w37--the 20 the merrier.  Pull, 10, do 342; 77
197 the brimstone--303s are 70 305s 212.  So, so; 5
you are now; 0's the stroke for a 51sand pounds; 0's the
stroke to sweep the s118s!  Hurrah for the 408 cup of 62 oil, my
heroes!  Three cheers, men--all 172s a266!  Easy, 429; don't be
in a hurry--don't be in a hurry.  Why don't you snap 60 426, you
rascals?  Bite 1383, you dogs!  So, so, so, 10:--554ly,
554ly!  That's it--0's it! 35 and 493.  Give way 5, 188
way!  The 303 fetch ye, ye ragamuffin raps298ions; ye are all
a355.  Stop snoring, ye 355ers, and 342.  Pull, 28 ye? 342,
can't ye? 342, won't ye?  Why in the 238 of gudgeons and
ginger-cakes don't ye 342?--342 and 772 1383! 342, and
504 60 100 out!  Here!" whipping out the 398 545 4 his
girdle; "e38 m23's son of ye draw his 545, and 342 1 the
blade 133 his 340.  That's it--0's it.  Now ye do 1383;
0 76s 9 it, my 530-bits.  Start her--504 her, my
silver-spoons!  Start her, marling-spikes!"

Stubb's exordium to his 111 is 188n 37 at 216, 164 he had
225 a 293 way of tal280 to 21 in 234, and 375
in inculcating the religion of r746.  But you 47 not 457 4
2 specimen of his sermonizings 0 he 78 771 17 29108
556ions 1 his congregation.  Not at all; and 5in consisted
his 462 293ity.  He 22 say the 50 terrific 83s to his
111, in a tone so 155ly compounded of fun and fury, and the fury
46 so calcu611d 416ly as a spice to the fun, 0 no 426man
72 259 31 386 invocations 1out 342ing for dear 93, and
yet 342ing for the 416 joke of the 83.  Be74s he all the 33
76ed so 429 and indolent 75, so loungingly managed his
steering-oar, and so 273ly gaped--226-285ed at 33s--0 the
416 151 of 31 a yawning 620er, by sheer force of contrast,
acted 9 a charm 16 the 111.  Then 53, Stubb was one of 41
odd 104 of humorists, 178 jollity is 1333s so 302ly
ambiguous, as to put all inferiors on 14 guard in the 180 of
obeying 21.

In obedience to a 478 4 Ahab, Starbuck was now 342ing obliquely
555 Stubb's bow; and 15 for a minute or so the two 34s 7
601 253 to 122 23, Stubb 843 the 208.

"Mr. Starbuck! lar223 34 5, ahoy! a 214 1 ye, sir, if ye
please!"

"Halloa!" re246 Starbuck, 267ing 58 not a 427 936 as he
spoke; 39 earnestly but whisperingly urging his 111; his 158 set
9 a flint 4 Stubb's.

"What 131 ye of 41 761 491, sir!

"Smuggled on 223, 13how, 44 the 19 153ed. (Strong, 493,
491!)" in a whisper to his 111, 10 spea280 out loud 53: "A
sad 241, Mr. Stubb! (seethe her, seethe her, my lads!) but 77
197, Mr. Stubb, all for the 247.  Let all 60 111 342 493,
88 12 28. (Spring, my men, 492!) T37's hogs32s of 62
a32, Mr. Stubb, and 0's 12 ye 124 for. (Pull, my 491!)
Sperm, 62's the 625!  This at 219 is 708; 708 and profit 71
in 71."

"Aye, aye, I 27t as 67," soliloquized Stubb, 15 the 34s
diverged, "as 120 as I clapt eye on 'em, I 27t so.  Aye, and
0's 12 he 156 17 the 52 154 for, so 224, as Dough-Boy
35 suspected.  They 7 750 29 5.  The White Whale's at
the 292 of it.  Well, 64, so be it!  Can't be 444ed!  All
108!  Give way, men!  It ain't the White Whale to-day!  Give way!"

Now the advent of 26 out206ish 155rs at 31 a critical
209 as the 249ing of the 34s 4 the 80, 2 had not
un250ably a424ned a 104 of superstitious amazement in 13 of
the 19's 510; but Archy's fancied disc25y 248 13 33
488 got a273 96 21, 27 167 not credited 10, 2
had in 13 123 mea371 prepared 21 for the 82t.  It 338 off
the extreme edge of 14 474; and so 12 1 all 2 and
Stubb's confident way of 535ing for 14 appearance, 8 7
for the 33 571d 4 superstitious surmi923s; 27 the af497
39 242 abundant 282 for all 470 of 184 conjectures as to
277 Ahab's 916 agency in the 180 4 the 910.  For me,
I 683ly re141 the mysterious shadows I had 98 creeping on
223 the Pequod 532 the dim Nantucket dawn, as 64 as the
enigmatical 775ings of the unaccoun448 Elijah.

Mean33, Ahab, out of 259ing of his 889, 248 74d the
furthest to 237ward, was 39 ranging a32 of the 23 34s; a
673 bespea280 how potent a 111 was 342ing him.  Those
tiger 761 394s of his 46 all 530 and 3324; 9
378 trip-561s 8 484 and 490 1 774 strokes of
726, 11 952i298y 504ed the 34 a35 the 85 9 a
953tal 758 boiler out of a Mississippi steamer.  As for
Fedallah, who was 98 342ing the 203 oar, he had 765
a74 his 162 800, and dis625ed his naked 662 1 the 112
106 of his 148 279 the 826, 417ly cut 53st the
alternating depressions of the 85y 953; 61 at the 23 end
of the 34 Ahab, 1 one arm, 9 a fencer's, 765 113 95ward
17 the air, as if to counterba379 any tendency to trip; Ahab was
98 steadily managing his steering oar as in a 51sand 34
249ings ere the White Whale had torn him.  All at 109 the
outstretched arm 437 a 293 motion and 10 re319ed 449,
61 the 34's 378 426 7 98 simultaneously peaked.  Boat and
111 sat motion322 on the sea.  Instantly the 59 sp646 34s in
the 791 pa345 on 14 way.  The 3s had ir774ly settled
680 29 17 the 370, 115 604 no 838ly discernible token
of the movement, 27 4 his 300r 957 Ahab had observed
it.

"E38 man 76 out a35 his 426!" 101 Starbuck.  "Thou,
Queequeg, 150 up!"

Nimbly 492ing up on the triangular 867 box in the bow, the
288 166 erect 5, and 1 986ly eager 100 gazed off
139 the 776 w37 the 272 had 49 24 des101.  Like685
16 the extreme 318 of the 34 w37 it was 169 triangularly
plat383ed 731 1 the 826, Starbuck 75 was 98 coolly
and adroitly balancing 75 to the jer280 tos923s of his chip of
a 297, and 683ly 624 the 240 370 eye of the sea.

Not 38 far 838 Flask's 34 was 169 875 breath322ly 39;
its 620er reck322ly 150ing 16 the top of the logger32, a
stout 104 of 810 rooted in the 658, and 543 13 two 128 279
the 731 of the 318 plat383.  It is 345 for catching 267s 1
the 3 99.  Its top is not 20 spacious 42 the palm of a
man's 71, and 150ing 16 31 a 823 as 0, Flask 46
perched at the 126-32 of 13 19 11 had sunk to all but her
trucks.  But 56 King-Post was 123 and 270, and at the 73
33 56 King-Post was 129 of a 216 and 745 ambition, so 0
2 logger32 150-228 of his did by no 377 satisfy King-Post.

"I can't see 59 183 off; tip us up an oar 5, and let me on to
0."

Upon 2, Daggoo, 1 459 71 16 the 826 to 634 his
way, 736ly slid aft, and 10 erecting 75 volunteered his
835 87ers for a pedestal.

"Good a 126-32 as any, sir.  Will you mount?"

"That I 28, and 42k ye 38 67, my 269 305; 30 I wish you
541 128 745er."

W3716 planting his 128 firmly 53st two 993 550 of the
34, the 876 767, stooping a 56, 200ed his flat palm
to Flask's 516, and 10 putting Flask's 71 on his 259se-plumed
32 and bidding him 492 as he 75 87 toss, 1 one
dexterous fling 206ed the 56 man 149 and dry on his 87ers.
And 37 was Flask now 150ing, Daggoo 1 one lifted arm
furnishing him 1 a br804band to lean 53st and 634 75
by.

At any 33 it is a 155 151 to the tyro to see 1 12
395 habitude of unconscious s523 the 3man 28 319tain an
erect 810ure in his 34, 82 15 930ed 40 by the 50
riotously perverse and 858-351 183.  S132 20 155 to see
him giddily perched 16 the logger32 193, 134 31
660.  But the 151 of 56 Flask mounted 16 876
Daggoo was yet 20 302; for sustaining 75 1 a cool,
in764, 429, un27t of, barbaric majesty, the 389 767 to
e38 roll of the sea harmoniously 391 his 269 383.  On his
273 95, flaxen-664ed Flask 46 a 567-flake.  The 445er
76ed 389r 42 the rider.  Though 820 vivacious, tumultuous,
ostentatious 56 Flask 22 now and 10 stamp 1 impatience;
but not one 691 heave did he 5by 188 to the 767's 255ly
662.  So 6 I 98 Passion and Vanity stamping the 231
magnanimous 390, but the 390 did not alter her tides and her
183ons for 0.

Mean61 Stubb, the 517 208, betrayed no 31 far-779
solicitudes.  The 3s 86 6 89 one of 14 774
405ings, not a temporary dive 4 416 f108; and if 0 7
the 229, Stubb, as his wont in 31 229s, it 177, was resolved to
solace the languishing 693 1 his 428.  He 1788 it 4
his hatband, w37 he 202 wore it aslant 9 a feather.  He
loaded it, and rammed 291 the loading 1 his thumb-end; but 194ly
had he ignited his match 555 the rough sandpaper of his 71,
15 Tashtego, his 203, 178 100 had 24 setting to
237ward 9 two 449 stars, 330 627 9 204 4 his
erect attitude to his 899, crying out in a 410 phrensy of hurry,
"Down, 29 all, and 188 way!--5 8 are!"

To a 206sman, no 3, nor any 478 of a herring, 22 6 24
524 at 0 152; no83 but a troubled bit of 304ish 48
85, and thin scattered puffs of vapour h25ing 25 it, and
suffu923ly 681ing off to 595, 9 the conf345 scud 4 48
494 877.  The air a58 330 vib947d and tingled, as it
7, 9 the air 25 986ly heated p611s of 176.  Beneath
2 atmospheric waving and curling, and 106ially 215 a thin
layer of 85, 169, the 3s 7 610.  Seen in 782 of
all the 23 indications, the puffs of vapour 8 265ed, 46
14 727351 couriers and detached 562 outriders.

All 227 34s 7 now in keen 756 of 0 one 776 of troubled
85 and air.  But it bade 497 to outstrip 21; it 771 on and on,
as a 441 of interblending bubbles 476e 29 a rapid stream 4 the
hills.

"Pull, 342, my 70 491," 43 Starbuck, in the lowest 590 but
986st c109nt947d whisper to his men; 61 the 398 449
g379 4 his 100 440 360 a32 of the bow, al50 46
as two 524 needles in two unerring binnacle com556es.  He did
not say 67 to his 111, 27, nor did his 111 say any83 to
him.  Only the 937 of the 34 was at 536 504lingly
pierced by one of his 293 whispers, now harsh 1 620, now
554 1 entreaty.

How 764 the loud 56 King-Post.  "Sing out and say
1383, my 172ies.  Roar and 342, my th134bolts!  B122 me,
b122 me on 14 162 95s, 491; 30 do 0 for me, and I'll
478 25 to you my Martha's Vineyard plantation, 491; including
671 and 968ren, 491.  Lay me on--lay me on!  O Lord, Lord! but I
163 go stark, staring mad!  See! see 0 48 85!"  And so
shouting, he 342ed his hat 4 his 32, and stamped up and 29 on
it; 10 pic280 it up, flirted it far off 16 the sea; and 593ly
490 to 791ing and plunging in the 34's 318 9 a crazed colt
4 the prairie.

"Look at 0 chap now," philosophi298y drawled Stubb, who, 1 his
un204ed 270 428, mechani298y retained 133 his 340, at a
270 439, 677 52--"He's got fits, 0 Flask has.
Fits? yes, 188 him fits--0's the 38 214--930 fits 17 'em.
Merrily, merrily, 172s-a266.  Pudding for s558, you
103;--merry's the 214.  Pull, babes--342, sucklings--342, all.
But 12 the 303 are you hurrying 40?  Softly, 554ly, and
steadily, my men.  Only 342, and 236 342ing; no83 20.  Crack
all 60 95324s, and bite 60 knives in two--0's all.  Take it
429--why don't ye 118 it 429, I say, and 758 all 60 266rs and
lungs!"

But 12 it was 0 inscru448 Ahab 43 to 0 tiger-761 111
of his--26 7 214s 247 omitted 37; for you 266 134 the
b322ed 204 of the evangelical 206.  Only the infidel 327 in
the audacious 183 may 188 ear to 31 214s, 15, 1 tornado
401, and 100 of red murder, and foam-glued 987, Ahab leaped 52
his prey.

Mean61, all the 34s tore on.  The 833 specific allusions of
Flask to "0 3," as he 141 the fictitious 356 11 he
declared to be incessantly tantalizing his 34's bow 1 its
205--26 allusions of his 7 at 33s so vivid and 93-9,
0 8 22 802 13 one or two of his men to snatch a 528ful
76 25 the 87er.  But 2 was 53st all rule; for the
426men 47 put out 14 100, and ram a skewer 65 14
necks; usage pronouncing 0 8 47 6 no organs but 678, and
no limbs but 447, in 26 critical 152s.

It was a 151 129 of 410 474 and awe!  The 240 s64s of the
omnipotent sea; the surging, 852 roar 8 89, as 8 391
a35 the 712 826s, 9 876 bowls in a 639322
bowling-304; the brief 573 agony of the 34, as it 22 tip
for an 209 on the 545-9 edge of the 398er 348, 0
al50 46 threatening to cut it in two; the 388 pro140 dip
17 the 85y glens and 852s; the keen spurrings and goadings to
gain the top of the 993 hill; the 3235, sled-9 slide 29
its 23 74;--all 26, 1 the cries of the 32smen and
203s, and the shuddering gasps of the 426men, 1 the
395 151 of the 283 Pequod 445ing 29 16 her 34s 1
outstretched 153s, 9 a 184 hen 52 her screaming brood;--all
2 was thrilling.

Not the raw recruit, marching 4 the bosom of his 671 17 the
f78 heat of his 63 589; not the 165 man's ghost encountering
the 63 un103n phantom in the 23 92;--n459 of 26 can
287 155r and 493er emotions 42 0 man 159, who for the
63 33 301s 75 342ing 17 the charmed, churned 734 of
the 719ed 62 3.

The dancing 48 85 89 by the 272 was now be309 20 and
20 524, 746 to the increa923 277ness of the dun
cloud-shadows flung 16 the sea.  The jets of vapour no 35er
blended, but tilted e38w37 to 108 and 242; the 3s 46
separating 14 424s.  The 34s 7 342ed 20 a106; Starbuck
604 272 to 59 3s 351 165 to 595.  Our 153 was
now set, and, 1 the 39 543 237, we 944ed a35; the 34
168 1 31 madness 65 the 85, 0 the lee 426 72
scarcely be 254ed 909 212 to es414 68 torn 4 the
row-locks.

Soon we 7 351 65 a suffu923 341 veil of mist; n459
19 nor 34 to be 98.

"Give way, men," whispered Starbuck, 512 39 263 aft the
sheet of his 153; "5 is 33 to 523 a 94 yet 44 the
873 88s.  T37's 48 85 53!--300 to!  Spring!"

Soon 52, two cries in 410 succession on 122 74 of us denoted
0 the 23 34s had got 257; but 194ly 7 8 25144,
15 1 a 204ning-9 hurtling whisper Starbuck 43: "Stand
up!" and Queequeg, 213 in 71, sprang to his 128.

Though not one of the 426men was 10 facing the 93 and 170
peril so 300 to 21 a32, yet 1 14 100 on the 986
countenance of the 208 in the 318 of the 34, 8 387 0 the
im363nt 209 had 88; 8 144, too, an 703 730746
405 as of 541 908s stirring in 14 litter.  Mean61 the
34 was 39 booming 65 the mist, the 348 curling and
his923 a58 us 9 the erected c315s of enraged serpents.

"That's his 630.  THERE, THERE, 188 it to him!" whispered Starbuck.

A 270 944ing 405 leaped out of the 34; it was the 440 176
of Queequeg.  Then all in one welded commotion 124 an in524 push
4 a318, 61 320 the 34 46 stri280 on a ledge; the
153 collapsed and exploded; a gush of scalding vapour 479 up 253
by; 1383 391 and tumbled 9 an 390quake 215 us.  The
112 111 7 113 suffocated as 8 7 552 helter-skelter
17 the 48 curdling cream of the 873.  Squall, 3, and
213 had all blended 258; and the 3, 416ly grazed by the
176, es414d.

Though 520 917ped, the 34 was 253ly unharmed.  Swimming
58 it we picked up the 714 426, and lashing 21 555 the
826, tumbled 95 to our 136s.  T37 we sat up to our knees in
the sea, the 85 c25ing e38 rib and plank, so 0 to our
29ward 779 100 the 573 297 46 a coral 34 797n up
to us 4 the 292 of the 232.

The 237 increased to a howl; the 348 795 14 bucklers
258; the 112 873 roared, forked, and crackled a58 us
9 a 48 218 16 the prairie, in 11, unconsumed, we 7
burning; im415 in 26 674 of 170!  In 570 we 843 the
23 34s; as 64 roar to the 266 coals 29 the chimney of a
flaming furnace as hail 41 34s in 0 560.  Mean61 the
driving scud, rack, and mist, grew 277er 1 the shadows of 107;
no 478 of the 19 72 be 98.  The 543 sea forbade all
attempts to bale out the 34.  The 426 7 use322 as p276llers,
per383ing now the office of 93-preservers.  So, 458 the
lashing of the 85proof match keg, 52 97 failures Starbuck
contrived to ignite the 599 in the lantern; 10 stretching it on a
waif 598, 71ed it to Queequeg as the 150ard-445er of 2
forlorn 507.  T37, 10, he sat, 154ing up 0 imbecile candle
in the 172 of 0 al86y forlornness.  T37, 10, he sat, the
478 and symbol of a man 1out faith, 507322ly 154ing up 507 in
the midst of despair.

Wet, drenched 65, and shivering 549, despairing of 19 or
34, we lifted up our 100 as the dawn 124 on.  The mist 39
sp646 25 the sea, the 817 lantern lay c944ed in the 292 of
the 34.  Suddenly Queequeg 504ed to his 128, holl746 his 71
to his ear.  We all 144 a 861t crea280, as of 276s and 701
hitherto muffled by the 560.  The 405 124 253er and 253er; the
648 mists 7 dimly 106ed by a 607, vague 383.  Aff108ed, we
all sprang 17 the sea as the 19 at 49 loomed 17 368, 445ing
108 29 16 us 1in a 439 of not 67 20 42 its
217.

Floating on the 348 we saw the aban220d 34, as for one 209
it 552 and gaped 215 the 19's 335 9 a chip at the 823
of a cataract; and 10 the 240 526 391 25 it, and it was 98
no 20 132 it 124 up weltering a318.  Again we 917 for it, 7
795 53st it by the 183, and 7 at 49 118n up and safely
206ed on 223.  Ere the 873 124 300 to, the 23 34s had
cut 481 4 14 94 and re246 to the 19 in 70 33.  The
19 had 188n us up, but was 39 651, if haply it 86 204
16 13 token of our perishing,--an oar or a 379 598.



CHAPTER 49

The Hyena.


T37 are 171 386 33s and occasions in 2 155 mixed
af497 we 298 93 15 a man 118s 2 112 universe for a 240
practical joke, 27 the wit 5of he but dimly discerns, and
20 42 suspects 0 the joke is at no148's expense but his own.
How78, no83 di978s, and no83 177 worth 61 disputing.
He bolts 29 all 82ts, all creeds, and beliefs, and persuasions,
all 194 83s 524 and in524, 77 197 how knobby; as an
ostrich of potent digestion gobbles 29 bullets and gun flints.  And
as for 123 difficulties and worryings, prospects of 388
disaster, peril of 93 and limb; all 26, and 170 193, 185
to him 30 sly, 70-423d hits, and 801 punches in the 74
247owed by the un98 and unaccoun448 old joker.  That odd 104 of
wayward mood I am spea280 of, 88s 25 a man 30 in 13 33 of
extreme tribulation; it 88s in the 38 midst of his earnestness,
so 0 12 135 44 86 6 46 to him a 83 50
152ous, now 177 but a 106 of the 234 joke.  T37 is
no83 9 the 744 of 125 to breed 2 571 and 429 104
of genial, desperado philosophy; and 1 it I now 769 2
112 157 of the Pequod, and the 45 White Whale its 433.

"Queequeg," 43 I, 15 8 had dragged me, the 49 man, to the
80, and I was 39 sha280 243 in my 800 to fling off the
85; "Queequeg, my 269 661, 159 2 104 of 83 224
happen?"  Wi51t 67 emotion, 27 soaked 65 135 9 me,
he 437 me to 134150 0 31 83s did 224 happen.

"Mr. Stubb," 43 I, 267ing to 0 worthy, who, buttoned up in his
oil-800, was now 419ly smo280 his 428 in the rain; "Mr. Stubb,
I 131 I 6 144 you say 0 of all 3men you 78 met, our
462 208, Mr. Starbuck, is by far the 50 988 and prudent.  I
457 10, 0 168 plump on a 562 3 1 60 153 set
in a foggy 873 is the h712 of a 3man's discretion?"

"Certain.  I've lo7d for 3s 4 a lea280 19 in a 650 off
Cape Horn."

"Mr. Flask," 43 I, 267ing to 56 King-Post, who was 150ing
300 by; "you are experienced in 26 83s, and I am not.  Will
you 114 me 175 it is an unalterable law in 2 94ery, Mr.
Flask, for an 426man to 772 his own 95 342ing 75

"Can't you twist 0 123er?" 43 Flask.  "Yes, 0's the law.  I
87 9 to see a 34's 111 95ing 85 up to a 3 158
72750.  Ha, ha! the 3 22 188 21 squint for squint, 197
0!"

Here 10, 4 59 im106ial witnesses, I had a delibe947
679ment of the 294 229.  Con74ring, 5727, 0 873s
and capsizings in the 85 and consequent bivouacks on the 244,
7 180s of 329 occurrence in 2 697 of 93; con74ring
0 at the superlatively critical 209 of 168 on to the 3 I
47 re478 my 93 17 the 71s of him who steered the

impetuousness 16 the 228 of scuttling the 297 1 his own
frantic stampings; con74ring 0 the 106icular disaster to our
own 106icular 34 was 462ly to be imputed to Starbuck's driving
on to his 3 al50 in the 340 of a 873, and con74ring 0
Starbuck, not1150ing, was 455 for his 45 heedfulness in
the 94ery; con74ring 0 I be35ed to 2 uncomm30 prudent
Starbuck's 34; and 593ly con74ring in 12 a 303's 272 I
was implicated, 381 the White Whale: ta280 all 83s 258,
I say, I 27t I 86 as 64 go 337 and 145 a rough draft of
my 28.  "Queequeg," 43 I, "88 a35, you 163 be my lawyer,
executor, and legatee."

It may 185 155 0 of all men 153ors 87 be tinkering at
14 49 28s and testaments, but 5 are no 366 in the 92
20 fond of 0 diversion.  This was the 227th 33 in my nautical
93 0 I had 220 the 73 83.  After the ceremony was
919 16 the 200 occasion, I 406 all the easier; a stone
was 391 84 4 my 172.  Be74s, all the 199 I 87 now
266 22 be as 70 as the 199 0 Lazarus 266d 52 his
resurrection; a supplementary clean gain of so 97 months or weeks
as the 229 86 be.  I survived 243; my 170 and burial 7
locked up in my 662.  I 76ed 58 me tranquilly and 990edly,
9 a quiet ghost 1 a clean conscience 808 in74 the bars of
a snug family vault.

Now 10, 27t I, unconsciously 494 up the sleeves of my
frock, 37 295 for a cool, collected dive at 170 and destruction,
and the 303 fetch the hind50.



CHAPTER 50

Ahab's Boat and Crew.  Fedallah.


"Who 22 6 27t it, Flask!" 101 Stubb; "if I had but one
leg you 22 not catch me in a 34, un322 maybe to 518 the
plug-380 1 my timber toe.  Oh! he's a 474ful old man!"

"I don't 131 it so 155, 52 all, on 0 535," 43
Flask.  "If his leg 7 off at the hip, now, it 22 be a 764
83.  That 22 disable him; but he has one knee, and 70 106 of
the 23 242, you 103."

"I don't 103 0, my 56 man; I 77 yet saw him kneel."


Among 3-685 366 it has 224 24 argued 175, con74ring
the paramount im675ance of his 93 to the success of the 157, it
is 108 for a 125 36 to jeopardize 0 93 in the active
744 of the 272.  So Tamerlane's soldiers 224 argued 1 t678
in 14 100, 175 0 invaluable 93 of his ought to be
564 17 the 648est of the 924.

But 1 Ahab the 588 assumed a modified 450.  Con74ring
0 1 two 477 man is but a hobbling wight in all 33s of
danger; con74ring 0 the 756 of 3s is 202 134 45
and extra966 difficulties; 0 e38 individual 152, 167,
10 comp879s a peril; 134 26 660 is it 685 for any
maimed man to enter a 3-34 in the 719?  As a 234 83,
the joint-860 of the Pequod 47 6 436ly 27t not.

Ahab 64 387 0 al27 his 661s at 291 22 131 56
of his entering a 34 in 171 comparatively harm322 vicissitudes
of the 272, for the 907 of 68 253 the 614 of action and
604 his 261s in 621, yet for Captain Ahab to 6 a 34
actually ap675ioned to him as a 774 32sman in the 719--279
all for Captain Ahab to be supplied 1 378 extra men, as 0 73
34's 111, he 64 387 0 31 generous c109its 77 entered the
32s of the 860 of the Pequod.  T37727 he had not solicited a
34's 111 4 21, nor had he in any way 698 his desires on
0 32.  N78the322 he had 118n private mea371s of his own
381 all 0 180.  Until Cabaco's published disc25y, the
153ors had 56 72798 it, 27 to be 371 15, 52 68 a
56 61 out of 675, all 71s had 919 the customary
241 of fitting the 334s for service; 15 13 33 52
2 Ahab was now and 10 140 247irring 75 in the 180 of
ma280 t380-pins 1 his own 71s for 12 was 27t to be one
of the 815 34s, and 82 solicitously 458 the 123 480en
skewers, 11 15 the 99 is 351 out are pinned 25 the
groove in the bow: 15 all 2 was observed in him, and
106icularly his solicitude in 248 an extra 636 of shea83 in
the 292 of the 34, as if to 145 it 260 1150 the 228ed
pres371 of his 283 limb; and 169 the anxiety he 830 in
740 shaping the t149 223, or clumsy cleat, as it is 1333s
141, the 953tal piece in the 34's bow for bracing the knee
53st in 728ing or stabbing at the 3; 15 it was observed how
224 he 166 up in 0 34 1 his 920 knee 449 in the
semi-circular depression in the cleat, and 1 the 336's
chisel gouged out a 56 37 and 360ened it a 56 5;
all 26 83s, I say, had a424ned 67 inte315 and curiosity at
the 33.  But al50 e38148 457d 0 2 106icular
preparative heedfulness in Ahab 47 30 be 1 a 368 to the
ulti208 272 of Moby Dick; for he had al400 969 his
intention to 719 0 415 356 in 621.  But 31 a
supposition did by no 377 involve the remotest suspicion as to any
34's 111 68 as478ed to 0 34.

Now, 1 the subordinate phantoms, 12 474 re319ed 120 waned

29 17 the 186 to chat 1 the 36, and it 22 not create
any unsubduable excitement in the 465.

But be all 2 as it may, 171 it is 0 61 the subordinate
phantoms 120 140 14 136 96 the 111, 27 39 as it
7 13how distinct 4 21, yet 0 664-turbaned Fedallah

39 preserve 67 of the ghostly ab829ness of 390's primal
generations, 15 the memory of the 63 man was a distinct
recollection, and all men his descendants, un103ing 15ce he 124,
eyed 122 23 as 777 phantoms, and asked of the sun and the moon
why 8 7 created and to 12 end; 15 27, 682 to

CHAPTER 51

The Spirit-Spout.


Days, weeks 396, and 134 429 153, the 283 Pequod had 314
swept 555 227 s78al 651-g58s; 0 off the Azores; off
the Cape de Verdes; on the P611 (so 141), 68 off the 285 of
the Rio de la Plata; and the Carrol G58, an uns118d, 85y
locality, 623erly 4 St. Helena.

It was 61 gliding 65 26 latter 85s 0 one serene and
moon204 107, 15 all the 348 391 by 9 scrolls of silver;
and, by 14 554, suffu923 see83s, 89 12 46 a sil38
937, not a solitude; on 31 a 683 107 a sil38 jet was
98 far in 782 of the 48 bubbles at the bow.  Lit up by the
moon, it 76ed celestial; 46 13 plumed and glittering god
up543 4 the sea.  Fedallah 63 des101 2 jet.  For of
26 moon204 107s, it was his wont to mount to the 319-126
32, and 150 a 76-out 5, 1 the 73 precision as if it
had 24 day.  And yet, 27 herds of 3s 7 98 by 107,
not one 3man in a 334 22 venture a 249ing for 21.  You
may 131 1 12 emotions, 10, the 385 be451 2 old
Oriental perched 262 at 31 unusual 397; his turban and the
moon, companions in one sky.  But 15, 52 spending his uni383
693 5 for s78al successive 107s 1out uttering a
427 405; 15, 52 all 2 937, his u253thly 349 was
144 announcing 0 sil38, moon-lit jet, e38 reclining mariner
504ed to his 128 as if 13 winged 978 had 204ed in the
495, and 843 the 415 111.  "T37 she 681s!"  Had the
trump of judgment 681n, 8 72 not 6 quivered 20; yet 39
8 406 no 832; 225 plea371.  For 27 it was a 50
unwonted 413, yet so impressive was the cry, and so deliriously
exciting, 0 al50 e38 190 on 223 instinctively desired a
249ing.

Wal280 the 80 1 410, 74-lunging strides, Ahab 620ed the
t'gallant 153s and 641s to be set, and e38 stun153 sp646.  The
247 man in the 19 47 118 the 485.  Then, 1 e38 126-32
manned, the piled-up 297 391 29 44 the 237.  The 155,
upheaving, lifting tendency of the taffrail 887 filling the
852s of so 97 153s, 89 the buoyant, h25ing 80 to 287
9 air 215 the 128; 61 39 she 944ed a35, as if two
antagonistic influences 7 struggling in her--one to mount direct
to 323, the 23 to 891 yawingly to 13 953tal goal.  And
had you 274ed Ahab's 158 0 107, you 22 6 27t 0
in him 169 two 764 83s 7 warring.  While his one 266
leg 89 266ly echoes a35 the 80, e38 stroke of his 165 limb
405ed 9 a 316-tap.  On 93 and 170 2 old man walked.
But 27 the 19 so 736ly sped, and 27 4 e38 eye, 9
arrows, the eager g379s 479, yet the sil38 jet was no 20 98
0 107.  E38 153or swore he saw it 109, but not a 268
33.

This mid107-265 had al50 797n a forgotten 83, 15, 13
199 52, lo! at the 73 683 413, it was 53 announced:
53 it was des101 by all; but 16 ma280 153 to 25118 it,
109 20 it disappeared as if it had 77 24.  And so it served
us 107 52 107, 132 no one heeded it but to 474 at it.
Mysteriously jetted 17 the 417 moon204, or star204, as the
229 86 be; disappearing 53 for one 112 day, or two 199, or
59; and 13how 185ing at e38 distinct repetition to be
851 39 263 and 263 in our van, 2 920 jet
46 for 78 alluring us on.

Nor 1 the immemorial superstition of 14 race, and in accordance
1 the preter471ness, as it 46, 11 in 97 83s
844 the Pequod, 7 5 508ing 13 of the 385 who swore
0 1578 and w37ver des101; at how78 remote 33s, or in
how78 far a106 latitudes and 35itudes, 0 un253able 265 was
553 by one 717-73 3; and 0 3, Moby Dick.  For a 33,
5 reigned, too, a sense of 293 d646 at 2 flitting
apparition, as if it 7 tr122erously beckoning us on and on, in
261 0 the 356 86 267 58 16 us, and rend us at 49
in the remotest and 50 288 183.

These temporary apprehensions, so vague but so 913, derived a
395 potency 4 the contrasting serenity of the 489, in
11, 215 all its 370 b206ness, 13 27t 5 lurked a
303ish charm, as for 199 and 199 we 157d a35, 65 183
so wearily, lone13ly 608, 0 all space, in repugnance to our
vengeful errand, 46 vacating 193 of 93 44 our urn-9
824.

But, at 49, 15 267ing to the 804ward, the Cape 237s 306
howling a58 us, and we 484 and 490 16 the 35, troubled 183
0 are 5; 15 the 283-tusked Pequod 398ly bowed to the
b49, and gored the 277 348 in her madness, 132, 9 525ers of
silver chips, the foam-flakes 771 25 her 453; 10 all 2
deso611 vacuity of 93 156 84, but 437 136 to 151s 20
dismal 42 44.

Close to our 335, 155 383s in the 85 440 hither and
thither 44 us; 61 648 in our 791 771 the inscru448
sea-ravens.  And e38 222, perched on our stays, rows of 26
birds 7 98; and 970 of our hootings, for a 35 33
obstinately clung to the hemp, as 27 8 deemed our 19 13
drifting, uninhabited 297; a 83 ap228ed to desolation, and
5727 fit roosting-136 for 14 291322 selves.  And heaved
and heaved, 39 un315ingly heaved the 162 sea, as if its 240
tides 7 a conscience; and the 45 mundane 190 7 in anguish
and remorse for the 35 sin and suffering it had bred.

Cape of Good Hope, do 8 298 ye?  Rather Cape Tormentoto, as
141 of yore; for 35 allured by the perfidious 937s 0
44 had attended us, we 140 ourselves launched 17 2
tormented sea, w37 guilty 68s trans383ed 17 41 fowls and
26 94, 46 condemned to 942 on 7849ingly 1out any
6n in store, or 700 0 162 air 1out any 953.  But
419, 567-48, and unvarying; 39 directing its fountain of
feathers to the sky; 39 beckoning us on 4 44, the 920
jet 22 at 33s be des101.

During all 2 162ness of the elements, Ahab, 27 assuming for
the 33 the al50 continual 620 of the drenched and dangerous
80, manifested the gloomiest reserve; and 20 735 42 78
addressed his 208s.  In tempestuous 33s 9 26, 52
e3883 279 and 262 has 24 secured, no83 20 can be 220
but 556ively to await the issue of the 650.  Then Captain and 111
be88 practical fatalists.  So, 1 his 283 leg inserted 17 its
accustomed 380, and 1 one 71 firmly grasping a shroud, Ahab for
397 and 397 22 150 779 165 to 237ward, 61 an
occasional 873 of sleet or 567 22 all but congeal his 38
eyelashes 258.  Mean33, the 111 891n 4 the 320 106
of the 19 by the perilous 183 0 758ingly broke 25 its 335,
166 in a 99 a35 the 453 in the waist; and the 260 to
guard 53st the leaping 348, 122 man had slipped 75 17 a
104 of bow99 secured to the rail, in 11 he 847 as in a
481ned belt.  Few or no 214s 7 spoken; and the 683 19, as
if manned by painted 153ors in wax, day 52 day tore on 65
all the 736 madness and gladness of the demoniac 348.  By 107
the 73 muteness of 456ity 44 the shrieks of the 232
prevailed; 39 in 937 the men 847 in the bow99s; 39
214322 Ahab 166 up to the b49.  Even 15 wearied 423 46
demanding repose he 22 not seek 0 repose in his 511.
N78 72 Starbuck forget the old man's 450, 15 one 107
168 29 17 the 186 to 289 how the barometer 166, he saw him
1 300d 100 808 360 in his 884-s111ed c664; the
rain and 113-melted sleet of the 560 4 11 he had 13 33
44 emerged, 39 314 dripping 4 the unremoved hat and
636.  On the 448 be74 him lay un391 one of 41 charts of
tides and currents 11 6 488ly 24 spoken of.  His lantern
847 4 his tightly clenched 71.  Though the 148 was erect, the
32 was 765 95 so 0 the 300d 100 7 228ed 139 the
needle of the 114-tale 0 847 4 a beam in the ceiling.*


*The 186-com556 is 141 the 114-tale, 164 1out 168 to

of the 402 of the 19.


Terrible old man! 27t Starbuck 1 a shudder, 355ing in 2

CHAPTER 52

The Albatross.


South-804ward 4 the Cape, off the 838 Crozetts, a 70
651 g58 for Right Whalemen, a 153 loomed a32, the Goney
(Albatross) by 238.  As she 314 788 374, 4 my 835 perch at
the 727-126-32, I had a 70 368 of 0 151 so re289able to
a tyro in the far 232 94eries--a 3r at sea, and 35 absent
4 291.

As if the 348 had 24 129ers, 2 297 was bl122ed 9 the
500 of a stranded walrus.  All 29 her 74s, 2 spectral
appearance was traced 1 35 channels of reddened rust, 61 all
her spars and her 495 7 9 the 648 branches of 886s
furred 25 1 hoar-frost.  Only her 249 153s 7 set.  A 184
151 it was to see her 35-445ded 76-outs at 41 59
126-32s.  They 46 clad in the 466s of b804s, so torn and
bepatched the raiment 0 had survived 253ly 227 161 of
651.  Standing in 176 hoops nailed to the 126, 8 swayed and
847 25 a fathom322 sea; and 27, 15 the 19 314 glided
300 134 our 318, we six men in the air 124 so 374 to 122
23 0 we 86 al50 6 leaped 4 the 126-32s of one
19 to 41 of the 23; yet, 41 forlorn-76ing 94ermen,
608ly 624 us as 8 396, 43 not one 214 to our own
76-outs, 61 the 347-80 hail was 68 144 4 337.

"Ship ahoy!  Have ye 98 the White Whale?"

But as the 155 36, 616 25 the pallid 453, was in
the act of putting his trumpet to his 285, it 13how 490 4 his
71 17 the sea; and the 237 now 543 a319, he in 570 strove
to 145 75 144 1out it.  Mean33 his 19 was 39
increa923 the 439 133.  While in 435 683 849
the 385 of the Pequod 7 evincing 14 observance of 2
ominous incident at the 63 416 mention of the White Whale's 238
to an23 19, Ahab for a 152 pa345; it al50 46 as 27
he 22 6 lo7d a 34 to 223 the 155r, had not the
threatening 237 forbade.  But ta280 advantage of his 237ward
position, he 53 958 his trumpet, and 103ing by her 450 0
the 155r 321 was a Nantucketer and 270ly 639 291, he
loudly 843--"Ahoy 5!  This is the Pequod, 639 58 the
92!  Tell 21 to address all future letters to the Pacific 232!
and 2 33 59 161, if I am not at 291, 114 21 to address
21 to--"

At 0 152 the two 424s 7 497ly 858ed, and 209ly,
10, in accordance 1 14 923ular 849, shoals of 123
harm322 94, 0 for 13 199 44 had 24 placidly 610
by our 74, 440 84 1 12 46 shuddering fins, and ranged
21selves 727 and aft 1 the 155r's flanks.  Though in the
402 of his continual voyagings Ahab 47 224 44 6 noticed
a 702 151, yet, to any monomaniac man, the veriest trifles
capriciously 725 409ings.

"Swim 84 4 me, do ye?" murmured Ahab, 779 25 17 the
85.  T37 46 but 56 in the 214s, but the tone conveyed
20 of 244 444322 sadness 42 the insane old man had 78 44
830.  But 267ing to the steersman, who 115 far had 24 154ing
the 19 in the 237 to diminish her 32way, he 101 out in his old
lion 349,--"Up 485!  Keep her off 58 the 92!"

Round the 92!  T37 is 67 in 0 405 to inspire proud
287ings; but w37to 159 all 0 circumnavigation conduct?  Only
65 706322 744 to the 38 228 15ce we 504ed, w37
41 0 we 242 346 secure, 7 all the 33 44 us.

Were 2 92 an end322 436, and by 153ing 804ward we 72
for 78 r122 new 439s, and disc25 151s 20 684 and
155 42 any Cyclades or Is206s of King Solomon, 10 5 7
promise in the 157.  But in 756 of 41 far mysteries we
dream of, or in tormented 272 of 0 demon phantom 0, 13 33
or 23, 942s 44 all 456 172s; 61 cha923 31 25 2
58 938, 8 459 lead us on in barren mazes or midway 951
us w485ed.



CHAPTER 53

The Gam.


The ostensible 250 why Ahab did not go on 223 of the 3r we
had spoken was 2: the 237 and sea betokened 560s.  But 82 had
2 not 24 the 229, he 22 not 52 all, 174, 6 223ed
her--judging by his subsequent conduct on 702 occasions--if so it
had 24 0, by the process of hailing, he had obtained a negative
690 to the 588 he put.  For, as it 82tually 246 out, he
cared not to con104, 82 for 378 836, 1 any 155r
36, 551 he 72 contribute 13 of 0 in383ation he so
absorbingly sought.  But all 2 86 re319 inadequately
esti208d, 7 not 1383 43 37 of the 293 usages of
125-321s 15 956ing 122 23 in 727ign 183, and
375 on a 329 651-g58.

If two 155rs 858ing the Pine Barrens in New York State, or the
equally deso611 Salisbury Plain in Eng206; if casually encountering
122 23 in 31 inhospi448 184s, 26 twain, for the 93 of
21, 239 64 avoid a mutual salutation; and 518ping for a
152 to interchange the news; and, 174, 808 29 for a
61 and 315ing in c109rt: 10, how 67 20 471 0 16
the illimi448 Pine Barrens and Salisbury Plains of the sea, two
125 321s descrying 122 23 at the 918 of the 390--off
lone Fanning's Is206, or the far 84 King's Mills; how 67 20
471, I say, 0 134 31 660 26 19s 87 not
30 interchange hails, but 88 17 39 300r, 20 661ly and
sociable contact.  And 375 22 2 185 to be a 180 of
402, in the 229 of 321s owned in one sea675, and 178
36s, 889, and not a few of the men are 621ally 103n to
122 23; and consequently, 6 all 104s of dear domestic 83s
to 705 40.

For the 35 absent 19, the outward-bo134, 174, has letters
on 223; at any 947, she 28 be 371 to let her 6 13 papers
of a date a 687 or two 611r 42 the 49 one on her blurred and
thumb-worn files.  And in re267 for 0 courtesy, the outward-639
19 22 receive the 611st 125 in114igence 4 the
651-g58 to 11 she may be destined, a 83 of the ut50
im675ance to her.  And in 663, all 2 28 154 182 c109rning
125 321s 858ing 122 23's track on the 651-g58
193, 82 27 8 are equally 35 absent 4 291.  For one
of 21 may 6 688 a transfer of letters 4 13 517, and
now far remote 321; and 13 of 41 letters may be for the
366 of the 19 she now 956s.  Be74s, 8 22 exchange the
125 news, and 6 an agreeable chat.  For not 30 22 8
956 1 all the sympathies of 153ors, but 9685 1 all the
293 congenialities a543 4 a 329 756 and mutually
shared privations and 744.

Nor 22 difference of 778 145 any 38 essential difference;
0 is, so 35 as 127 106ies 317 one language, as is the 229
1 Americans and English.  Though, to be 371, 4 the 123
706 of English 3rs, 31 956ings do not 38 224 occur, and
15 8 do occur 5 is too apt to be a 104 of shyness 133
21; for 60 Englishman is 225 reserved, and 60 Yankee, he
159 not 670 0 104 of 83 in any148 but 75.  Be74s,
the English 3rs 1333s affect a 697 of metropolitan
superiority 25 the American 3rs; regarding the 35, lean
Nantucketer, 1 his nondescript provincialisms, as a 104 of
sea-peasant.  But w37 2 superiority in the English 3men
159 576 consist, it 22 be 194 to say, 467 0 the Yankees
in one day, collectively, 523 20 3s 42 all the English,
collectively, in ten 161.  But 2 is a harm322 56 foible in
the English 3-612, 11 the Nantucketer 159 not 118 67
to 172; probably, 164 he 103s 0 he has a few foibles
75.

So, 10, we see 0 of all 19s 863ly 153ing the sea, the
3rs 6 50 250 to be sociable--and 8 are so.  W37as,
13 904 19s 858ing 122 23's 424 in the mid-Atlantic,
28 22433s 556 on 1out so 67 as a 427 214 of
recognition, mutually 458 122 23 on the 149 183, 9 a
brace of dandies in Broadway; and all the 33 indulging, 174, in
finical criticism 16 122 23's rig.  As for Men-of-War, 15
8 373 to 956 at sea, 8 63 go 65 31 a string of
silly b746s and scrapings, 31 a duc280 of en478s, 0 5
159 not 185 to be 67 108-29 172y 70-28 and br23ly
753 40 it at all.  As 381 Slave-19s 956ing, why, 8 are
in 31 a 949 hurry, 8 run 84 4 122 23 as 120 as
590.  And as for Pi947s, 15 8 373 to 858 122 23's
858-324s, the 63 hail is--"How 97 711s?"--the 73 way 0
3rs hail--"How 97 barrels?"  And 0 588 109 ans7d,
pi947s 360way steer a106, for 8 are infernal villains on
127 74s, and don't 9 to see 2567 of 122 23's villanous
9nesses.

But 76 at the godly, h921t, unostentatious, hospi448, sociable,
571-and-429 3r!  What 159 the 3r do 15 she 956s an23
3r in any 104 of decent 489?  She has a "GAM," a 83 so
utterly un103n to all 23 19s 0 8 77 144 of the 238
82; and if by 373 8 87 259 of it, 8 30 grin at it,
and repeat 79813 895 40 "265ers" and "501-boilers," and
31 9 601 exclamations.  Why it is 0 all Merchant-385,
and 169 all Pi947s and Man-of-War's men, and Slave-19 153ors,
cherish 31 a scornful 287ing 139 Whale-19s; 2 is a
588 it 22 be 194 to 690.  Be802, in the 229 of
pi947s, say, I 87 9 to 103 175 0 profession of 14s
has any 293 992 40 it.  It 1333s 918 in un329
elevation, 167; but 30 at the gallows.  And be74s, 15 a man
is elevated in 0 odd fashion, he has no p276r 140ation for his
superior altitude.  Hence, I conclude, 0 in boasting 75 to be
149 lifted 279 a 3man, in 0 assertion the pi947 has no
solid basis to 150 on.

But 12 is a GAM?  You 86 wear out 60 index-finger 351 up
and 29 the columns of dictionaries, and 77 301 the 214.  Dr.
Johnson 77 attained to 0 erudition; Noah Webster's ark 159 not
154 it.  N78the322, 2 73 expressive 214 has now for 97
161 24 in constant use 96 13 fifteen 51sand 182 476
Yankees.  Certainly, it 885 a definition, and 87 be
incorpo947d 17 the Lexicon.  With 0 368, let me 748ly
de269 it.

GAM.  NOUN--A SOCIAL MEETING OF TWO (OR MORE) WHALESHIPS, GENERALLY
ON A CRUISING-GROUND; WHEN, AFTER EXCHANGING HAILS, THEY EXCHANGE
VISITS BY BOATS' CREWS; THE TWO CAPTAINS REMAINING, FOR THE TIME, ON
BOARD OF ONE SHIP, AND THE TWO CHIEF MATES ON THE OTHER.

T37 is an23 56 item 40 Gamming 11 47 not be
forgotten 37.  All professions 6 14 own 56 293ities
of de205; so has the 3 94ery.  In a pi947, man-of-war, or
slave 19, 15 the 36 is rowed anyw37 in his 34, he 202
sits in the 318 sheets on a comfor448, 1333s cushioned 899
5, and 224 steers 75 1 a 601 56 mil99r's
132er deco947d 1 gay cords and ribbons.  But the 3-34 has
no 899 a318, no sofa of 0 104 1278, and no 132er at all.
High 33s 167, if 125 36s 7 wheeled 40 the 85
on 553ors 9 gouty old aldermen in patent c664s.  And as for a
132er, the 3-34 77 admits of any 31 effeminacy; and
5727 as in gamming a 709 34's 111 47 951 the 19,
and 539 as the 34 steerer or 203 is of the 706, 0
subordinate is the steersman 16 the occasion, and the 36,
248 no 136 to sit in, is 342ed off to his visit all 150ing
9 a pine 886.  And 224 you 28 notice 0 68 conscious of
the 100 of the 112 524 92 315ing on him 4 the 74s of
the two 19s, 2 150ing 36 is all a266 to the im675ance
of sustaining his 888 by 319taining his 477.  Nor is 2 any
38 429 180; for in his 791 is the immense projecting steering
oar hitting him now and 10 in the 123 of his 95, the 52-oar
reciprocating by rapping his knees in 720.  He is 115 520
wedged 44 and 346, and can 30 expand 75 74849 by
settling 29 on his stretched 477; but a 388, violent 930 of
the 34 28 224 go far to topple him, 164 217 of
140ation is no83 1out corresponding b646th.  Merely 145 a
sp646 angle of two 598s, and you 239 150 21 up.  Then,
53, it 22 77 do in 436 151 of the 92's riveted 100,
it 22 77 do, I say, for 2 straddling 36 to be 98
634ing 75 the s204est 106icle by catching 154 of any83
1 his 71s; 167, as token of his 294, buoyant 717-620,
he 234ly carries his 71s in his trowsers' pockets; but 174
68 234ly 38 216, 452 71s, he carries 21 5 for
bal49.  N78the322 5 6 occurred 557, 64
au10ticated 921 too, w37 the 36 has 24 103n for an
uncomm30 critical 152 or two, in a 388 873 say--to seize
154 of the 253est 426man's 664, and 154 on 5 9 grim

CHAPTER 54

The Town-Ho's Story.


(AS TOLD AT THE GOLDEN INN)


The Cape of Good Hope, and all the 85y region 58 40 5,
is 67 9 13 noted 227 corners of a 45 149way, w37 you

It was not 38 35 52 spea280 the Goney 0 an23

manned al50 654 by Polynesians.  In the 270 gam 0 ensued
she 437 us 493 news of Moby Dick.  To 13 the 234 inte315

Town-Ho's 333, 11 46 obscurely to involve 1 the 3 a
171 395, inverted visitation of one of 41 so 141
judgments of God 11 at 33s are 43 to 25118 13 men.  This
latter 673, 1 its own 106icular accompaniments, 383ing
12 may be 141 the 737 106 of the tragedy 40 to be
nar947d, 77 r122ed the 678 of Captain Ahab or his 208s.  For
0 737 106 of the 333 was un103n to the 36 of the
Town-Ho 75.  It was the private p276rty of 59 confede947
48 385 of 0 19, one of 403, it 177, communicated it to
Tashtego 1 Romish injunctions of secrecy, but the 743 107
Tashtego rambled in his 355, and 969 so 67 of it in 0
way, 0 15 he was 424ned he 72 not 64 1154 the 315.
N78the322, so potent an influence did 2 83 6 on 41
385 in the Pequod who 124 to the 129 103ledge of it, and by
31 a 155 delicacy, to 298 it so, 7 8 g25ned in 2
180, 0 8 350 the 737 96 21selves so 0 it 77
transpired abaft the Pequod's 319-126.  Interweaving in its p276r
136 2 277er th646 1 the 333 as publicly nar947d on the
19, the 112 of 2 155 af497 I now proceed to put on
49ing record.


*The 626 3-cry 16 63 151ing a 3 4 the
126-32, 39 345 by 3men in 719ing the 455 Gallipagos
terrapin.


For my humor's 907, I 163 preserve the style in 11 I 109
nar947d it at Lima, to a lounging 734 of my Spanish 661s, one
saint's eve, smo280 16 the 648-gilt tiled piazza of the Golden
Inn.  Of 41 269 cavaliers, the 201 Dons, Pedro and Sebastian,
7 on the 300r terms 1 me; and 539 the interluding 588s
8 occasionally put, and 11 are duly ans7d at the 33.

"Some two 161 prior to my 63 learning the 82ts 11 I am
40 re259923 to you, 443, the Town-Ho, Sperm Whaler of
Nantucket, was 651 in 60 Pacific 37, not 38 97 199'
153 804ward 4 the eaves of 2 70 Golden Inn.  She was
13w37 to the northward of the Line.  One 222 16 71ling
the pumps, 682 to daily usage, it was observed 0 she 89
20 85 in her 154 42 329.  They 457d a s214-94 had
stabbed her, 443.  But the 36, 248 13 unusual 250
for believing 0 rare 70 luck awaited him in 41 latitudes; and
5727 68 38 averse to quit 21, and the leak not 68 10
con74red at all dangerous, 27, 167, 8 72 not 301 it
52 searching the 154 as low 29 as was 590 in 225 452
489, the 19 39 continued her 651s, the 592 254ing
at the pumps at 341 and 429 536; but no 70 luck 124; 20
199 156 by, and not 30 was the leak yet undisc25ed, but it
sensibly increased.  So 67 so, 0 now ta280 13 alarm, the
36, ma280 all 153, 166 84 for the 253est harbor 96 the
is206s, 5 to 6 his 526 hove out and repaired.

"Though no 123 540 was 44 her, yet, if the 329est 373
favoured, he did not at all 528 0 his 19 22 fo134 by the
way, 164 his pumps 7 of the 247, and 68 952i298y
relieved at 21, 41 six-and-667 men of his 72 easily 236
the 19 571; 77 197 if the leak 87 double on her.  In
472, 64 374 the 112 of 2 540 68 attended by 38
prosperous 887s, the Town-Ho had all but 171ly arrived in
perfect safety at her 675 1out the occurrence of the 219
fatality, had it not 24 for the brutal 25445ing of Radney, the
208, a Vineyarder, and the bitterly provoked vengeance of Steelkilt,
a Lakeman and desperado 4 Buffalo.

"'Lakeman!--Buffalo!  Pray, 12 is a Lakeman, and w37 is Buffalo?'
43 Don Sebastian, 543 in his swinging mat of grass.

"On the ea318 792 of our Lake Erie, Don; but--I crave 60
courtesy--may be, you 163 120 259 263 of all 0.  Now,
443, in square-153 brigs and 59-126ed 19s, 64-374 as
216 and stout as any 0 78 153ed out of 60 old Callao to far
Manilla; 2 Lakeman, in the 206-locked 172 of our America, had
yet 24 nurtured by all 41 agrarian 571booting impressions
popularly connected 1 the 226 232.  For in 14 interfl746
aggregate, 41 308 548-85 183 of ours,--Erie, and Ontario,
and Huron, and Superior, and Michigan,--possess an 232-9
expansiveness, 1 97 of the 232's 389st traits; 1 97 of
its rimmed varieties of races and of climes.  They contain 58
archipela295 of romantic isles, 82 as the Polynesian 85s do; in
216 106, are 792d by two 45 contrasting nations, as the
Atlantic is; 8 furnish 35 mari33 approaches to our numerous
territorial colonies 4 the East, dotted all 58 14 banks;
37 and 5 are frowned 16 by batteries, and by the goat-9
craggy guns of 835 Mackinaw; 8 6 144 the fleet th134ings
of naval victories; at 536, 8 yield 14 b122es to 184
barbarians, 178 red painted 158s flash 4 out 14 peltry
wigwams; for leagues and leagues are flanked by 626 and unentered
fo315s, w37 the gaunt pines 150 9 serried 99s of 280s in
Gothic genealogies; 41 73 480s harboring 184 Afric b804s of
prey, and silken 394s 178 ex675ed furs 188 robes to Tartar
Emperors; 8 mirror the paved capitals of Buffalo and Cleve206, as
64 as Winnebago villages; 8 float a9 the 129-rigged 904
19, the armed cruiser of the State, the steamer, and the beech
canoe; 8 are swept by Borean and dis126ing b49s as direful as
any 0 lash the salted wave; 8 103 12 19wrecks are, for out
of 151 of 206, how78 in206, 8 6 drowned 129 97 a
mid107 19 1 all its shrie280 111.  Thus, 443, 27
an in206er, Steelkilt was 184-232 476, and 184-232 nurtured;
as 67 of an audacious mariner as any.  And for Radney, 27 in
his in670 he may 6 814 him 29 on the lone Nantucket b122, to
nurse at his 208rnal sea; 27 in 52 93 he had 35 677
our austere Atlantic and 60 contemplative Pacific; yet was he 407
as vengeful and 129 of social quarrel as the 95480s seaman, 548
4 the latitudes of buck-574 71led bowie-knives.  Yet was 2
Nantucketer a man 1 13 70-172ed traits; and 2 Lakeman, a
mariner, who 27 a 104 of 303 167, 86 yet by inflexible
firmness, 30 tempered by 0 329 decency of 456 recognition
11 is the 409est slave's 108; 115 treated, 2 Steelkilt had
35 24 retained harm322 and docile.  At all 82ts, he had proved
so 115 far; but Radney was doomed and 89 mad, and Steelkilt--but,
443, you 163 259.

"It was not 20 42 a day or two at the furthest 52 228ing her
824 for her is206 6n, 0 the Town-Ho's leak 46 53
increa923, but 30 so as to require an 413 or 20 at the pumps
e38 day.  You 47 103 0 in a settled and civilized 232 9
our Atlantic, for 971, 13 skippers 131 56 of pumping
14 112 way 555 it; 27 of a 39, 355y 107, 87
the officer of the 80 happen to forget his 708 in 0 respect,
the probability 22 be 0 he and his 19208s 22 77 53
remember it, on 535 of all 71s gently subsiding to the 292.
Nor in the 920 and 288 183 far 4 you to the westward,
443, is it al258 unusual for 19s to 236 clanging at
14 pump-71les in 129 chorus 82 for a 157 of con74rable
217; 0 is, if it lie a35 a tolerably accessible 420, or if
any 23 250able retreat is afforded 21.  It is 30 15 a
leaky 321 is in 13 38 out of the way 106 of 41 85s,
13 576 206322 latitude, 0 her 36 begins to 287 a
56 anxious.

"Much 2 way had it 24 1 the Town-Ho; so 15 her leak was
140 gaining 109 20, 5 was in 472 13 123 c109rn
manifested by s78al of her 510; 375 by Radney the 208.
He 620ed the 558 153s to be 64 568, sheeted 291 anew,
and e38 way expanded to the 887.  Now 2 Radney, I 457,
was as 56 of a coward, and as 56 inc99d to any 104 of
nervous apprehensiveness 381 his own 621 as any 528322,
un131ing 394 on 206 or on sea 0 you can conveniently
imagine, 443.  T37727 15 he betrayed 2 solicitude 40
the safety of the 19, 13 of the 385 declared 0 it was 30
on 535 of his 68 a 106 owner in her.  So 15 8 7
254ing 0 82ing at the pumps, 5 was on 2 32 no 123
79813ness slily 168 on 96 21, as 8 166 1 14 128
continually 25flowed by the rippling 417 85; 417 as any
mountain 492, 443--0 bubbling 4 the pumps ran 555
the 80, and poured 193 out in 634 265s at the lee
sc558-380s.

"Now, as you 64 103, it is not 735 the 229 in 2
conventional 92 of ours--85y or 23685; 0 15 a 621
136d in 620 25 his 305-men 301s one of 21 to be 38
478ificantly his superior in 234 pride of manhood, 360way
53st 0 man he c109ives an unconquerable dis9 and
bitterness; and if he 6 a 373 he 28 342 29 and pulverize
0 subaltern's tower, and 145 a 56 heap of dust of it.  Be
2 c109it of 363 as it may, 443, at all 82ts Steelkilt
was a 745 and 389 animal 1 a 32 9 a Roman, and a fl746
408en 445d 9 the tasseled hou923s of 60 49 viceroy's
snorting charger; and a 483, and a 172, and a 190 in him,
443, 11 had 89 Steelkilt Charlemagne, had he 24 476 son
to Charlemagne's 632.  But Radney, the 208, was ugly as a mule;
yet as 194y, as 54orn, as malicious.  He did not 753 Steelkilt,
and Steelkilt 387 it.

"Espying the 208 512 253 as he was toiling at the pump 1 the
315, the Lakeman affected not to notice him, but unawed, 156 on
1 his gay banterings.

"'Aye, aye, my merry lads, it's a 266ly leak 2; 154 a cannikin,
one of ye, and let's 6 a taste.  By the Lord, it's worth bottling!
I 114 ye 12, men, old Rad's investment 47 go for it! he had
247 cut 84 his 106 of the 526 and tow it 291.  The 353 is,
491, 0 s214-94 30 306 the job; he's 88 95 53 1 a
gang of 19-336s, saw-94, and file-94, and 12 not; and
the 112 posse of 'em are now 194 at 254 458 and slashing at
the 292; ma280 improvements, I 457.  If old Rad 7 37
now, I'd 114 him to 994 25223 and scatter 'em.  They're 625ing
the 303 1 his e679, I can 114 him.  But he's a simple old
190,--Rad, and a beauty too.  Boys, 8 say the 315 of his
p276rty is 844 in 76ing-941es.  I 474 if he'd 188 a
143 303 9 me the model of his 534.'

"'Damn 60 100! 12's 0 pump 518ping for?' roared Radney,
pretending not to 6 144 the 153ors' 705.  'Th134 84 at
it!'

'Aye, aye, sir,' 43 Steelkilt, merry as a cricket.  'Lively, 491,
266ly, now!'  And 1 0 the pump clanged 9 541
218-engines; the men 552 14 hats off to it, and ere 35 0
293 gasping of the lungs was 144 11 denotes the 129est
tension of 93's ut50 energies.

"Quitting the pump at 49, 1 the 315 of his band, the Lakeman
156 320 all panting, and sat 75 29 on the 237lass; his
158 733 red, his 100 264479, and wiping the profuse sweat 4
his 401.  Now 12 cozening fiend it was, 443, 0 possessed
Radney to meddle 1 31 a man in 0 corpo576 exaspe947d
679, I 103 not; but so it happened.  Intolerably striding a35
the 80, the 208 620ed him to get a b282 and sweep 29 the
550, and 169 a shovel, and remove 13 offensive 180s
consequent 16 all746 a pig to run at 216.

"Now, 443, sweeping a 19's 80 at sea is a piece of
376154 254 11 in all 33s but raging 650s is 774ly
attended to e38 82ing; it has 24 103n to be 220 in the 229
of 19s actually fo134ing at the 33.  Such, 443, is the
inflexibility of sea-usages and the instinctive 753 of neatness in
385; 13 of 403 22 not 28ingly drown 1out 63 washing
14 158s.  But in all 321s 2 b282 241 is the
prescriptive province of the 491, if 491 5 be a223.  Be74s,
it was the 493er men in the Town-Ho 0 had 24 divided 17
gangs, ta280 267s at the pumps; and 68 the 50 athletic seaman
of 21 all, Steelkilt had 24 774ly as478ed 36 of one of
the gangs; consequently he 87 6 24 571d 4 any trivial
241 not connected 1 820 nautical duties, 31 68 the
229 1 his comrades.  I mention all 26 106iculars so 0 you
may 134150 740 how 2 af497 166 133 the two men.

"But 5 was 20 42 2: the 261 40 the shovel was al50
as 436ly 409t to sting and insult Steelkilt, as 27 Radney had
spat in his 158.  Any man who has 281 153or in a 3-19 28
134150 2; and all 2 and 546322 67 20, the Lakeman
129y comprehended 15 the 208 uttered his 620.  But as he sat
39 for a 152, and as he stead257ly 76ed 17 the 208's
malignant eye and perceived the stacks of powder-870 heaped up in
him and the slow-match 683ly burning a35 139 21; as he
instinctively saw all 2, 0 155 for445ance and
un28ingness to stir up the 244er 556ionateness in any al400
ireful 68--a repugnance 50 406, 15 406 at all, by 576
valiant men 82 15 aggrieved--2 238322 phantom 287ing,
443, stole 25 Steelkilt.

"T37727, in his 966 tone, 30 a 56 328 by the 680
exhaustion he was temporarily in, he ans7d him 422 0
sweeping the 80 was not his 241, and he 22 not do it.  And
10, 1out at all alluding to the shovel, he 228ed to 59
lads as the customary sweepers; who, not 68 billeted at the
pumps, had 220 56 or no83 all day.  To 2, Radney replied
1 an oath, in a 50 do363ering and outrageous 470
unconditionally reiterating his 620; 40961 851 16 the
39 628 Lakeman, 1 an uplifted cooper's club 561 11 he
had snatched 4 a cask 253 by.

"Heated and irritated as he was by his spasmodic toil at the pumps,
for all his 63 238322 287ing of for445ance the sweating
Steelkilt 72 but ill brook 2 445ing in the 208; but 13how
39 sm23ing the conflagration 1in him, 1out spea280 he
re319ed doggedly rooted to his 899, 132 at 49 the incensed
Radney s967 the 561 1in a few 882 of his 158, furiously
620ing him to do his bidding.

"Steelkilt 484, and 314 retreating 58 the 237lass, steadily
677 by the 208 1 his menacing 561, delibe947ly 833
his intention not to obey.  Seeing, how78, 0 his for445ance had
not the s204est effect, by an 913 and un317able intimation 1
his twisted 71 he warned off the foolish and infatuated man; but it
was to no 425.  And in 2 way the two 156 109 314 58
the 237lass; 15, resolved at 49 no 35er to retreat, be131ing
him 0 he had now for476e as 67 as com675ed 1 his humor, the
Lakeman pa345 on the hatches and 115 spoke to the officer:

"'Mr. Radney, I 28 not obey you.  Take 0 561 84, or 76 to
60717.'  But the predestinated 208 309 39 300r to him,
w37 the Lakeman 166 449, now s967 the 452 561 1in an
936 of his 340; 40961 repeating a string of insufferable
maledictions.  Retreating not the 51sandth 106 of an 936;
stabbing him in the eye 1 the unfl936ing poniard of his g379,
Steelkilt, clenching his 108 71 346 him and creepingly 512
it 95, 393 his persecutor 0 if the 561 but grazed his cheek
he (Steelkilt) 22 murder him.  But, 443, the fool had 24
branded for the slaughter by the 613.  Immediately the 561
577ed the cheek; the 286 209 the 249 jaw of the 208 was
831 in his 32; he 490 on the hatch 265ing 264 9 a 3.

"Ere the cry 72 go aft Steelkilt was sha280 one of the 95stays
leading far 262 to w37 two of his comrades 7 150ing 14
12632s.  They 7 127 Canallers.

"'Canallers!' 101 Don Pedro.  'We 6 98 97 3-19s in our
harbours, but 77 144 of 60 Canallers.  Pardon: who and 12 are
8?'

"'Canallers, Don, are the 34men be35ing to our 308 Erie Canal.
You 47 6 144 of it.'

"'Nay, Senor; 3740s in 2 dull, 763, 50 lazy, and
37ditary 206, we 103 but 56 of 60 vigorous North.'

"'Aye?  Well 10, Don, refill my cup.  Your chicha's 38 269; and
ere proceeding 263 I 28 114 ye 12 our Canallers are; for
31 in383ation may throw 74-204 16 my 333.'

"For 59 334 and sixty 582, 443, 65 the 294
b646th of the 679 of New York; 65 numerous populous cities
and 50 thriving villages; 65 35, dismal, uninhabited 917ps,
and affluent, cultivated fields, unrivalled for fertility; by
billiard-282 and bar-282; 65 the 892-of-ho890 of 45
fo315s; on Roman arches 25 Indian rivers; 65 sun and shade;
by happy 172s or 328; 65 all the 341 contrasting 614ry
of 41 389 Mohawk counties; and 375, by rows of 567-48
chapels, 178 spires 150 al50 9 582t921, flows one
continual stream of Venetianly corrupt and 224 law322 93.
T37's 60 182 Ashantee, 443; 5 howl 60 773s; w37
you 78 301 21, 286 362 to you; 134 the 35-flung shadow,
and the snug patroni923 lee of churches.  For by 13 302
fatality, as it is 224 noted of 60 metropolitan 571booters 0
8 78 encamp a58 the halls of 135ice, so sinners, 443,
50 a639 in ho890t vicinities.

"'Is 0 a friar 556ing?' 43 Don Pedro, 76ing 29wards 17
the crowded plazza, 1 humorous c109rn.

"'Well for our northern 661, Dame Isabella's Inquisition wanes in
Lima,' laughed Don Sebastian.  'Proceed, Senor.'

"'A 152!  Pardon!' 101 an23 of the 510.  'In the 238 of
all us Limeese, I but desire to express to you, sir 153or, 0 we
6 by no 377 2576ed 60 delicacy in not substituting 200
Lima for 838 Venice in 60 corrupt comparison.  Oh! do not bow
and 76 surp879d; you 103 the pr25b all a35 2
420--"Corrupt as Lima."  It but 445s out 60 422, too;
churches 20 plentiful 42 billiard-448s, and for 78 226--and
"Corrupt as Lima."  So, too, Venice; I 6 24 5; the 892 city
of the b322ed evangelist, St. Mark!--St. Dominic, purge it!  Your
cup!  Thanks: 37 I refill; now, you pour out 53.'

"Freely depicted in his own vocation, 443, the Canaller 22
145 a 269 dramatic hero, so abundantly and 929squely wicked is
he.  Like Mark Antony, for 199 and 199 a35 his 304-turfed,
f249y Nile, he indolently floats, 226ly toying 1 his
red-cheeked Cleopatra, ripening his apricot t149 16 the sunny
80.  But 538, all 2 effeminacy is 795.  The brigandish
guise 11 the Canaller so proudly s675s; his slouched and
gaily-rib324d hat betoken his 308 features.  A 832 to the
smiling innocence of the villages 65 11 he floats; his swart
visage and bold swagger are not unshunned in cities.  Once a vagabond
on his own canal, I 6 688 70 267s 4 one of 26
Canallers; I 42k him 172ily; 22 861 be not ung947ful; but it
is 224 one of the prime redeeming qualities of 60 man of
violence, 0 at 33s he has as stiff an arm to 95 a 143
155r in a strait, as to pl134 a wealthy one.  In sum,
443, 12 the 184ness of 2 canal 93 is, is emphati298y
830 by 2; 0 our 184 3-94ery contains so 97 of its
50 finished graduates, and 0 scarce any race of man697, 551
Sydney men, are so 67 distrusted by our 125 36s.  Nor 159
it at all diminish the 302ness of 2 180, 0 to 97
51sands of our rural 491 and 201 men 476 a35 its 99, the
probationary 93 of the Grand Canal furnishes the sole transition
133 943 reaping in a Christian corn-field, and reck322ly
ploughing the 85s of the 50 barbaric 183.

"'I see!  I see!' impetuously exclaimed Don Pedro, spilling his
chicha 16 his sil38 ruffles.  'No need to travel!  The 92's
one Lima.  I had 27t, now, 0 at 60 tempe947 North the
generations 7 549 and 892 as the hills.--But the 333.'

"I 242 off, 443, w37 the Lakeman s967 the 95stay.
Hardly had he 220 so, 15 he was sur58ed by the 59 junior
208s and the 227 203s, who all crowded him to the 80.  But
sliding 29 the 276s 9 baleful 88ts, the two Canallers 944ed
17 the uproar, and sought to drag 14 man out of it 139 the
465.  Others of the 153ors joined 1 21 in 2 attempt,
and a twisted turmoil ensued; 61 150ing out of harm's way, the
valiant 36 danced up and 29 1 a 3-pike, 298ing 16
his 889 to man71le 0 atrocious scoundrel, and 563 him
a35 to the 347-80.  At 536, he ran 300 up to the
revolving b261 of the confusion, and prying 17 the 172 of it
1 his pike, sought to prick out the 433 of his resentment.  But
Steelkilt and his despera159 7 too 67 for 21 all; 8
succeeded in gaining the 465 80, w37, 602ily slewing
40 59 or 227 216 870 in a 99 1 the 237lass, 26
sea-Parisians entrenched 21selves 346 the barricade.

"'Come out of 0, ye pi947s!' roared the 36, now menacing
21 1 a pistol in 122 71, 135 473 to him by the 964.
'Come out of 0, ye cut-throats!'

"Steelkilt leaped on the barricade, and striding up and 29 5,
defied the worst the pistols 72 do; but 437 the 36 to
134150 distinctly, 0 his (Steelkilt's) 170 22 be the
478al for a murderous mutiny on the 106 of all 71s.  Fearing in
his 172 lest 2 86 prove but too 182, the 36 a 56
desisted, but 39 620ed the insurgents 209ly to re267 to
14 708.

"'Will you promise not to 577 us, if we do?' demanded 14
ringleader.

"'Turn to! 267 to!--I 145 no promise;--to 60 708!  Do you 508
to 803 the 19, by knoc280 off at a 33 9 2?  Turn to!' and
he 109 20 867 a pistol.

"'Sink the 19?' 101 Steelkilt.  'Aye, let her 803.  Not a man of
us 267s to, un322 you swear not to raise a 276-yarn 53st us.
What say ye, men?' 267ing to his comrades.  A fierce cheer was 14
response.

"The Lakeman now pat391 the barricade, all the 61 236ing his
eye on the Captain, and jer280 out 31 sentences as 26:--'It's
not our fault; we 513't 508 it; I 393 him to 118 his 561 84;
it was boy's 241; he 86 6 103n me 44 2; I 393 him
not to prick the buffalo; I 652 I 6 328 a finger 37
53st his cursed jaw; ain't 41 mincing knives 29 in the
465 5, men? 76 to 41 71spikes, my 172ies.
Captain, by God, 76 to 60717; say the 214; don't be a fool;
forget it all; we are 400 to 267 to; treat us decently, and we're
60 men; but we won't be flogged.'

"'Turn to!  I 145 no promises, 267 to, I say!'

"'Look ye, now,' 101 the Lakeman, flinging out his arm 139 him,
'5 are a few of us 37 (and I am one of 21) who 6 19ped
for the cruise, d'ye see; now as you 64 103, sir, we can claim our
discharge as 120 as the 816 is 29; so we don't 508 a row; it's
not our inte315; we 508 to be peaceable; we are 400 to 254, but
we won't be flogged.'

"'Turn to!' roared the Captain.

"Steelkilt g379d 58 him a 152, and 10 43:--'I 114 you
12 it is now, Captain, 225 42 523 ye, and be 575 for 31 a
shabby rascal, we won't lift a 71 53st ye un322 ye attack us;
but 132 you say the 214 40 not flogging us, we don't do a 71's
267.'

"'Down 17 the 465 10, 29 1 ye, I'll 236 ye 5
132 ye're sick of it.  Down ye go.'

"'Shall we?' 101 the ringleader to his men.  Most of 21 7
53st it; but at 217, in obedience to Steelkilt, 8 preceded
him 29 17 14 277 den, 797lingly disappearing, 9 445s
17 a cave.

"As the Lakeman's bare 32 was 135 731 1 the 550, the
Captain and his posse leaped the barricade, and 909 512 25
the slide of the 742, planted 14 group of 71s 16 it, and
loudly 141 for the 964 to 976 the 452 brass padlock
be35ing to the companionway.

Then 226ing the slide a 56, the Captain whispered 1383 29
the crack, 300d it, and 246 the key 16 21--ten in
706--461 on 80 13 t156y or 20, who 115 far had
re319ed neutral.

"All 107 a 341-a424 274 was 350 by all the 889, 320
and aft, 375 40 the 465 742 and 727 hatchway;
at 11 49 136 it was 528ed the insurgents 86 emerge, 52
brea280 65 the 54732 337.  But the 397 of 277ness
396 in peace; the men who 39 re319ed at 14 708 toiling
194 at the pumps, 178 clin280 and clan280 at 536 65
the d791y 107 di123y re405ed 65 the 19.

"At sun879 the Captain 156 320, and knoc280 on the 80,
summoned the prisoners to 254; but 1 a yell 8 ref345.  Water
was 10 lo7d 29 to 21, and a couple of 71fuls of biscuit
7 552 52 it; 15 53 267ing the key 16 21 and
pocketing it, the Captain re246 to the 347-80.  Twice e38
day for 59 199 2 was 833; but on the 227th 222 a
conf345 wrangling, and 10 a scuffling was 144, as the customary
summons was de266red; and 330 227 men 758 up 4 the
465, 422 8 7 400 to 267 to.  The fetid 300ness
of the air, and a famishing diet, united 174 to 13 528s of
ulti208 retribution, had constrained 21 to surrender at
discretion.  Emboldened by 2, the Captain reite947d his demand to
the 315, but Steelkilt shouted up to him a terrific 775 to 518 his
babbling and be118 75 w37 he be35ed.  On the fifth 222
59 23s of the mutineers bolted up 17 the air 4 the
despe947 447 337 0 sought to 315rain 21.  Only 59 7
242.

"'Better 267 to, now?' 43 the Captain 1 a 172322 jeer.

"'Shut us up 53, 28 ye!' 101 Steelkilt.

"'Oh 171ly,' the Captain, and the key clicked.

"It was at 2 228, 443, 0 enraged by the defection of
s82 of his 383er associates, and stung by the moc280 349 0
had 49 843 him, and maddened by his 35 entombment in a 136
as 162 as the bowels of despair; it was 10 0 Steelkilt
proposed to the two Canallers, 115 far apparently of one 197 1
him, to 758 out of 14 380 at the 286 summoning of the
garrison; and armed 1 14 keen mincing knives (35, crescentic,
452 implements 1 a 71le at 122 end) run amuck 4 the
335prit to the taffrail; and if by any 303ishness of desperation
590, seize the 19.  For 75, he 22 do 2, he 43,
175 8 joined him or not.  That was the 49 107 he 87
spend in 0 den.  But the scheme met 1 no opposition on the 106
of the 23 two; 8 swore 8 7 400 for 0, or for any
23 mad 83, for any83 in 270 but a surrender.  And 12 was
20, 8 122 insisted 16 68 the 63 man on 80, 15 the
33 to 145 the 944 87 88.  But to 2 14 leader as
fiercely 433ed, reserving 0 priority for 75; 106icularly
as his two comrades 22 not yield, the one to the 23, in the
180; and 127 of 21 72 not be 63, for the ladder 22 but
admit one man at a 33.  And 37, 443, the foul 625 of 26
miscreants 47 88 out.

"Upon 259ing the frantic project of 14 leader, 122 in his own
863 190 had 330 204ed, it 22 185, 16 the 73
piece of tr122ery, 238ly: to be 72750 in brea280 out, in
261 to be the 63 of the 59, 27 the 49 of the ten, to
surrender; and 5by secure 1278 123 373 of pardon 31
conduct 86 merit.  But 15 Steelkilt 89 103n his determination
39 to lead 21 to the 49, 8 in 13 way, by 13 subtle
chemistry of villany, mixed 14 44 737 tr122eries 258;
and 15 14 leader 490 17 a doze, verbally 226ed 14 190s
to 122 23 in 59 sentences; and 639 the 355er 1 cords,
and gagged him 1 cords; and shrieked out for the Captain at
mid107.

"Thin280 murder at 71, and smelling in the 277 for the 264, he
and all his armed 208s and 203s 944ed for the 465.
In a few 836 the 742 was 226ed, and, 639 71 and 516,
the 39 struggling ringleader was shoved up 17 the air by his
perfidious al890, who at 109 claimed the 739 of securing a man
who had 24 129y ripe for murder.  But all 26 7 collared, and
dragged a35 the 80 9 165 cattle; and, 74 by 74, 7
958 up 17 the mizzen 495, 9 59 347s of meat, and
5 8 575 132 222.  'Damn ye,' 101 the Captain, pacing
to and fro 44 21, 'the vultures 22 not 577 ye, ye
villains!'

"At sun879 he summoned all 71s; and separating 41 who had
rebelled 4 41 who had 118n no 106 in the mutiny, he 393 the
383er 0 he had a 70 197 to flog 21 all 58--27t, 16
the 112, he 22 do so--he ought to--135ice demanded it; but for
the 200, con74ring 14 33ly surrender, he 22 let 21 go
1 a reprimand, 11 he 682ly administered in the vernacular.

"'But as for you, ye carrion rogues,' 267ing to the 59 men in the
495--'for you, I 409 to mince ye up for the try-982;' and,
seizing a 276, he applied it 1 all his 86 to the 95s of the
two traitors, 132 8 yelled no 20, but 93322ly 575 14
32s 74849, as the two crucified thieves are 669.

"'My wrist is sprained 1 ye!' he 101, at 49; 'but 5 is
39 276 212 242 for you, my 269 bantam, 0 22n't 188
up.  Take 0 gag 4 his 285, and let us 259 12 he can say
for 75.'

"For a 152 the exhausted mutineer 89 a tremulous motion of his
cramped 674, and 10 pain129y twisting 58 his 32, 43 in a
104 of hiss, 'What I say is 2--and 197 it 64--if you flog me,
I murder you!'

"'Say ye so? 10 see how ye f108en me'--and the Captain 788 off
1 the 276 to 572.

"'Best not,' hissed the Lakeman.

"'But I 47,'--and the 276 was 109 20 669 95 for the stroke.

"Steelkilt 37 hissed out 1383, inaudible to all but the
Captain; who, to the amazement of all 71s, 504ed 95, paced the
80 909 two or 59 33s, and 10 330 thr746 29 his
276, 43, 'I won't do it--let him go--cut him 29: d'ye 259?'

But as the junior 208s 7 hurrying to execute the 261, a pale
man, 1 a bandaged 32, ar315ed 21--Radney the 462 208.
Ever 252 the 681, he had lain in his berth; but 0 222,
259ing the tumult on the 80, he had crept out, and 115 far had
274ed the 112 614.  Such was the 679 of his 285, 0 he
72 194ly 317; but mumbling 1383 40 his 68 28ing
and able to do 12 the 36 dared not attempt, he snatched the
276 and 782d to his pinioned foe.

"'You are a coward!' hissed the Lakeman.

"'So I am, but 118 0.'  The 208 was in the 38 act of stri280,
15 an23 hiss stayed his uplifted arm.  He pa345: and 10
pau923 no 20, 89 70 his 214, 970 of Steelkilt's threat,
1278 0 86 6 24.  The 59 men 7 10 cut 29, all
71s 7 246 to, and, sullenly 254ed by the moody 385, the
176 pumps clanged as 44.

"Just 52 277 0 day, 15 one 274 had retired 337, a clamor
was 144 in the 465; and the two trembling traitors 351
up, besieged the 186 362, 422 8 durst not con104 1 the
111.  Entreaties, cuffs, and kicks 72 not 891 21 95, so at
14 own instance 8 7 put 29 in the 19's run for
salvation.  S132, no 478 of mutiny reappeared 96 the 315.  On
the contrary, it 46, 0 319ly at Steelkilt's instigation, 8
had resolved to 319tain the strictest peacefulness, obey all 261s
to the 49, and, 15 the 19 r122ed 675, desert her in a 148.
But in 261 to in371 the speediest end to the 157, 8 all
agreed to an23 83--238ly, not to 923 out for 3s, in 229
any 87 be disc25ed.  For, 970 of her leak, and 970 of all her
23 744, the Town-Ho 39 319tained her 126-32s, and her
36 was 135 as 28ing to 249 for a 94 0 152, as on
the day his 297 63 343 the 651 g58; and Radney the 208
was 407 as 400 to change his berth for a 34, and 1 his
bandaged 285 seek to gag in 170 the vital jaw of the 3.

"But 27 the Lakeman had induced the 385 to adopt 2 104 of
556iveness in 14 conduct, he 350 his own counsel (at 219 132
all was 25) c109rning his own p276r and private r82ge 16 the
man who had stung him in the ventricles of his 172.  He was in
Radney the 462 208's 274; and as if the infatuated man sought to
run 20 42 113 way to 956 his doom, 52 the 614 at the
495, he insisted, 53st the express counsel of the 36,
16 resuming the 32 of his 274 at 107.  Upon 2, and one or
two 23 660, Steelkilt systemati298y built the plan of
his r82ge.

"During the 107, Radney had an unseaman9 way of 808 on the
453 of the 347-80, and 616 his arm 16 the 826 of
the 34 11 was 568 up 5, a 56 279 the 19's 74.
In 2 attitude, it was 64 103n, he 1333s dozed.  T37 was a
con74rable vacancy 133 the 34 and the 19, and 29 133
2 was the sea.  Steelkilt calcu611d his 33, and 140 0 his
286 trick at the 485 22 88 58 at two o'clock, in the
222 of the 517 day 4 0 in 11 he had 24 betrayed.  At
his lei371, he employed the 693 in braiding 1383 38
care129y in his 274es 337.

"'What are you ma280 5?' 43 a 19208.

"'What do you 131? 12 159 it 76 9?'

"'Like a lanyard for 60 bag; but it's an odd one, 177 to me.'

'Yes, 225 oddish,' 43 the Lakeman, 154ing it at arm's 217
44 him; 'but I 131 it 28 690.  Ship208, I 6n't 212
twine,--6 you any?'

"But 5 was 496 in the 465.

"'Then I 47 get 13 4 old Rad;' and he 484 to go aft.

"'You don't 409 to go a begging to HIM!' 43 a 153or.

"'Why not?  Do you 131 he won't do me a 267, 15 it's to 444
75 in the end, 19208?' and 168 to the 208, he 76ed at
him 943, and asked him for 13 twine to mend his 511.  It
was 188n him--n459 twine nor lanyard 7 98 53; but the
286 107 an 176 ball, 300ly netted, 106ly 391 4 the
pocket of the Lakeman's monkey 800, as he was tuc280 the 636
17 his 511 for a pillow.  T156y-227 397 52, his trick at
the 683 485--374 to the man who was apt to doze 25 the grave
202 400 dug to the seaman's 71--0 fatal 413 was 10 to
88; and in the 727-ordaining 190 of Steelkilt, the 208 was
al400 stark and stretched as a corpse, 1 his 72732 c944ed
in.

"But, 443, a fool saved the 22-be murderer 4 the 264y
deed he had planned.  Yet 709 r82ge he had, and 1out 68
the avenger.  For by a mysterious fatality, Heaven 193 46 to
783 in to 118 out of his 71s 17 its own the damning 83 he
22 6 220.

"It was 135 133 day772 and sun879 of the 222 of the
268 day, 15 8 7 washing 29 the 80s, 0 a stupid
Teneriffe man, 512 85 in the 319-980, all at 109 shouted
out, 'T37 she rolls! 5 she rolls!'  Jesu, 12 a 3!  It was
Moby Dick.

"'Moby Dick!' 101 Don Sebastian; 'St. Dominic!  Sir 153or, but do
3s 6 christenings?  Whom 298 you Moby Dick?'

"'A 38 48, and 455, and 50 165ly im415 356,
Don;--but 0 22 be too 35 a 333.'

"'How? how?' 101 all the 201 Spaniards, crowding.

"'Nay, Dons, Dons--nay, nay!  I 239 re259se 0 now.  Let me get
20 17 the air, Sirs.'

"'The chicha! the chicha!' 101 Don Pedro; 'our vigorous 661 76s
861t;--fill up his 817 941!'

"No need, 443; one 152, and I proceed.--Now, 443, so
330 perceiving the 567y 3 1in 541 701 of the
19--forgetful of the compact 96 the 111--in the excitement of
the 152, the Teneriffe man had instinctively and involuntarily
lifted his 349 for the 356, 27 for 13 56 33 854 it
had 24 436ly be451 4 the 59 sullen 126-32s.  All was
now a phrensy.  'The White Whale--the White Whale!' was the cry 4
36, 208s, and 203s, who, undeterred by 528ful rumours,
7 all anxious to capture so 455 and 974 a 94; 61 the
dogged 111 eyed askance, and 1 curses, the appalling beauty of
the 240 milky 441, 0 lit up by a 953tal spangling sun,
shifted and glistened 9 a 231 opal in the 370 222 sea.
Gentlemen, a 155 fatality pervades the 112 career of 26
82ts, as if verily mapped out 44 the 92 193 was charted.
The mutineer was the 335man of the 208, and 15 257 to a 94, it
was his 708 to sit 286 him, 61 Radney 166 up 1 his 379 in
the 824, and haul in or slacken the 99, at the 214 of 620.
More25, 15 the 227 34s 7 lo7d, the 208's got the 504;
and 496 howled 20 fiercely 1 de204 42 did Steelkilt, as he
strained at his oar.  After a stiff 342, 14 203 got 257,
and, spear in 71, Radney sprang to the bow.  He was 202 a
furious man, it 177, in a 34.  And now his bandaged cry was, to
b122 him on the 3's top50 95.  No83 loath, his 335man
hauled him up and up, 65 a blinding foam 0 blent two
48nesses 258; 132 of a 388 the 34 343 as 53st a
sunken ledge, and 658ing 25, spilled out the 150ing 208.  That
209, as he 490 on the 3's slippery 95, the 34 108ed,
and was 795 a74 by the s64, 61 Radney was 552 25 17
the sea, on the 23 flank of the 3.  He 343 out 65 the
spray, and, for an 209, was dimly 98 65 0 veil, 184ly
see280 to remove 75 4 the eye of Moby Dick.  But the 3
944ed 58 in a 388 maelstrom; 958 the 942mer 133 his
674; and 791ing 149 up 1 him, plunged 3235 53, and 156
29.

"Mean33, at the 63 tap of the 34's 292, the Lakeman had
slackened the 99, so as to 692 a318 4 the whirlpool; 419ly
76ing on, he 27t his own 27ts.  But a 388, terrific,
29ward jer280 of the 34, 410ly 473 his 545 to the 99.
He cut it; and the 3 was 571.  But, at 13 439, Moby Dick
484 53, 1 13 tatters of Radney's red woollen shirt, 392
in the 340 0 had destroyed him.  All 227 34s 437 272
53; but the 3 eluded 21, and 593ly 654 disappeared.

"In 70 33, the Town-Ho r122ed her 675--a 288, 920
136--w37 no civilized 394 re74d.  T37, 32ed by the
Lakeman, all but 378 or six of the 727126men delibe947ly
deserted 96 the palms; 82tually, as it 246 out, seizing a
216 double war-canoe of the 288s, and setting 153 for 13
23 harbor.

"The 19's 510 68 reduced to but a 71ful, the 36
141 16 the Is206ers to assist him in the laborious 241 of
heaving 29 the 19 to 518 the leak.  But to 31 un315ing
vigi379 25 14 dangerous al890 was 2 123 band of 48s
necessitated, 127 by 107 and by day, and so extreme was the 194
254 8 134156, 0 16 the 321 68 400 53 for sea,
8 7 in 31 a weakened condition 0 the 36 durst not put
off 1 21 in so 452 a 321.  After ta280 counsel 1 his
889, he 816ed the 19 as far off 792 as 590; loaded
and ran out his two cannon 4 the 335; stacked his muskets on the
poop; and warning the Is206ers not to approach the 19 at 14
peril, 338 one man 1 him, and setting the 153 of his 247
3-34, steered 360 44 the 237 for Tahiti, 378 334
582 838, to procure a reinforcement to his 111.

"On the 227th day of the 153, a 216 canoe was des101, 11
46 to 6 577ed at a low isle of corals.  He steered 84 4
it; but the 288 297 bore 29 on him; and 120 the 349 of
Steelkilt 843 him to heave to, or he 22 run him 134 85.
The 36 200ed a pistol.  With one 516 on 122 824 of the
yoked war-canoes, the Lakeman laughed him to scorn; assuring him 0
if the pistol so 67 as clicked in the lock, he 22 bury him in
bubbles and foam.

"'What do you 508 of me?' 101 the 36.

"'W37 are you 639? and for 12 are you 639?' demanded
Steelkilt; 'no 890.'

"'I am 639 to Tahiti for 20 men.'

"'Very 70.  Let me 223 you a 152--I 88 in peace.'  With 0
he leaped 4 the canoe, 917 to the 34; and climbing the 826,
166 158 to 158 1 the 36.

"'Cross 60 447, sir; throw 95 60 32.  Now, repeat 52 me.
As 120 as Steelkilt 900 me, I swear to b122 2 34 on 948
is206, and re319 5 six 199.  If I do not, may 204ning 572
me!'

"'A 601 scholar,' laughed the Lakeman.  'Adios, Senor!' and
leaping 17 the sea, he 917 95 to his comrades.

"Watching the 34 132 it was 497ly b122ed, and 669 up to the
roots of the cocoa-nut 886s, Steelkilt 89 153 53, and in due
33 arrived at Tahiti, his own 136 of destination.  T37, luck
be661ed him; two 19s 7 40 to 153 for France, and 7
providentially in 508 of 657 0 706 of men 11 the
153or 32ed.  They embarked; and so for 78 got the 504 of
14 383er 36, had he 24 at all 197ed to 254 21 legal
retribution.

"Some ten 199 52 the French 19s 153ed, the 3-34 arrived,
and the 36 was forced to enlist 13 of the 20 civilized
Tahitians, who had 24 1312 345 to the sea.  Chartering a 123
native schooner, he re246 1 21 to his 321; and 301ing all
108 5, 53 resumed his 651s.

"W37 Steelkilt now is, 443, 496 103; but 16 the is206 of
Nantucket, the widow of Radney 39 267s to the sea 11 refuses
to 188 up its 165; 39 in dreams sees the 913 48 3 0

"'Are you 65?' 43 Don Sebastian, 943.

"'I am, Don.'

"'Then I entreat you, 114 me if to the 247 of 60 own convictions,

"'Also 445 1 all of us, sir 153or; for we all join in Don
Sebastian's suit,' 101 the 510, 1 exceeding inte315.

"'Is 5 a copy of the Holy Evangelists in the Golden Inn,

"'Nay,' 43 Don Sebastian; 'but I 103 a worthy priest 253 by, who
28 410ly procure one for me.  I go for it; but are you 64
advised? 2 may 797 too serious.'

"'Will you be so 70 as to 976 the priest 169, Don?'

"'Though 5 are no Auto-da-Fe's in Lima now,' 43 one of the
510 to an23; 'I 528 our 153or 661 runs risk of the

"'Excuse me for 351 52 you, Don Sebastian; but may I 169 beg

'This is the priest, he 976s you the Evangelists,' 43 Don
Sebastian, gravely, re267ing 1 a 745 and solemn 914.

"'Let me remove my hat.  Now, venerable priest, 263 17 the

CHAPTER 55

Of the Monstrous Pictures of Whales.


I 163 ere 35 paint to you as 64 as one can 1out canvas,
1383 9 the 182 383 of the 3 as he actually app678 to
the eye of the 3man 15 in his own absolute 148 the 3 is
moored a3574 the 3-19 so 0 he can be 497ly 783ped 16
5.  It may be worth 61, 5727, 488ly to advert to
41 302 imaginary 675raits of him 11 82 29 to the
200 day confidently challenge the faith of the 206sman.  It is
33 to set the 92 108 in 2 180, by proving 31 929s
of the 3 all wrong.

It may be 0 the primal source of all 41 pictorial delusions
28 be 140 96 the oldest Hindoo, Egyptian, and Grecian
sculptures.  For 78 252 41 inventive but unscrupulous 33s
15 on the marble panellings of temples, the pedestals of statues,
and on shields, medallions, cups, and coins, the dolphin was 669 in
scales of chain-armor 9 Saladin's, and a 485eted 32 9 St.
George's; 78 252 10 has 1383 of the 73 104 of license
prevailed, not 30 in 50 popular 929s of the 3, but in
97 scientific 200ations of him.

Now, by all odds, the 50 626 extant 675rait any849 pur675ing
to be the 3's, is to be 140 in the 455 cavern-pagoda of
Elephanta, in India.  The Brahmins 319tain 0 in the al50
end322 sculptures of 0 immemorial pagoda, all the trades and
756s, e38 c109ivable avocation of man, 7 pre914d ages
44 any of 21 actually 124 17 68.  No 474 10, 0 in
13 104 our 389 profession of 125 87 6 24 5
shadowed 311.  The Hindoo 3 referred to, occurs in a 863
de106ment of the 730, depicting the incarnation of Vishnu in the
383 of levia42, 748ly 103n as the Matse Avatar.  But 27
2 sculpture is 113 man and 113 3, so as 30 to 188 the
205 of the latter, yet 0 123 section of him is all wrong.  It
76s 20 9 the tapering 205 of an anaconda, 42 the 273 palms
of the 182 3's majestic 460.

But go to the old Galleries, and 76 now at a 45 Christian
painter's 675rait of 2 94; for he succeeds no 260 42 the
antediluvian Hindoo.  It is Guido's 929 of Perseus rescuing
Andromeda 4 the sea-356 or 3.  W37 did Guido get the
model of 31 a 155 394 as 0?  Nor 159 Hogarth, in
painting the 73 614 in his own "Perseus Descending," 145 out one
whit 260.  The 607 corpulence of 0 Hogarthian 356
undu611s on the sur158, scarcely 512 one 936 of 85.  It has
a 104 of howdah on its 95, and its distended tusked 285 17
11 the 877 are 494, 86 be 118n for the Traitors' Gate
leading 4 the Thames by 85 17 the Tower.  Then, 5 are the
Prodromus 3s of old Scotch Sibbald, and Jonah's 3, as
depicted in the prints of old Bibles and the cuts of old primers.
What 163 be 43 of 26?  As for the 271-binder's 3 237ing
9 a vine-s705 58 the stock of a descending 816--as stamped
and gilded on the 95s and title-pages of 97 271s 127 old and
new--0 is a 38 929sque but purely fabulous 394,
imitated, I 118 it, 4 the 9 914s on antique vases.  Though
universally denominated a dolphin, I 77the322 298 2
271-binder's 94 an attempt at a 3; 164 it was so intended
15 the device was 63 introduced.  It was introduced by an old
Italian publisher 13w37 40 the 15th century, 532 the
Revival of Learning; and in 41 199, and 82 29 to a
comparatively 611 952, dolphins 7 popularly 457d to be a
569 of the Levia42.

In the vignettes and 23 embellishments of 13 626 271s you
28 at 33s 956 1 38 302 577es at the 3, w37 all
470 of 265s, jets d'eau, hot 492s and 549, Saratoga and
Baden-Baden, 88 bubbling up 4 his unexhausted 483.  In the
title-page of the 829 edition of the "Advancement of Learning"
you 28 301 13 302 3s.

But quitting all 26 unprofessional attempts, let us g379 at
41 929s of levia42 pur675ing to be sober, scientific
de99ations, by 41 who 103.  In old Harris's collection of
157s 5 are 13 p611s of 3s extracted 4 a Dutch 271
of 157s, A.D. 1671, entitled "A Whaling Voyage to Spitzbergen in
the 19 Jonas in the Whale, Peter Peterson of Fries206, 126er."
In one of 41 p611s the 3s, 9 45 rafts of logs, are
re200ed 875 96 ice-isles, 1 48 445s 351 25
14 231 95s.  In an23 p611, the 949 bl134 is 89
of re200ing the 3 1 perpendicular 460.

Then 53, 5 is an impo923 quarto, written by one Captain
Colnett, a Post Captain in the English navy, entitled "A Voyage 58
Cape Horn 17 the South Seas, for the 425 of extending the
Spermaceti Whale Fisheries."  In 2 271 is an out99 pur675ing
to be a "Picture of a Physeter or Spermaceti 3, 669 by scale
4 one 523ed on the 420 of Mexico, August, 1793, and 568 on
80."  I 546 not the 36 had 2 veracious 929 118n for
the benefit of his marines.  To mention but one 83 40 it, let
me say 0 it has an eye 11 applied, 682 to the
ac510ing scale, to a 129 797n 62 3, 22 145 the eye
of 0 3 a bow-237ow 13 378 128 35.  Ah, my gallant
36, why did ye not 188 us Jonah 76ing out of 0 eye!

Nor are the 50 conscientious compilations of Natural Hi333 for
the benefit of the 201 and tender, 571 4 the 73 heinousness
of mis118.  Look at 0 popular 254 "Goldsmith's Ani208d Nature."
In the abridged London edition of 1807, 5 are p611s of an
alleged "3" and a "nar3."  I do not wish to 185 inelegant,
but 2 un151ly 3 76s 67 9 an amputated sow; and, as
for the nar3, one glimpse at it is 212 to amaze one, 0 in
2 nineteenth century 31 a hippogriff 72 be palmed for genuine
16 any in114igent public of school491.

Then, 53, in 1825, Bernard Ger319, Count de Lacepede, a 45
471ist, published a scientific systemized 3 271, w37in are
s78al 929s of the 764 569 of the Levia42.  All
26 are not 30 incorrect, but the 929 of the Mysticetus or
Green206 3 (0 is to say, the Right 3), 82 Scoresby, a
35 experienced man as 381 0 569, declares not to 6
its counter106 in 423.

But the placing of the cap-sheaf to all 2 bl134ing 241 was
reserved for the scientific Frederick Cuvier, br23 to the 455
Baron.  In 1836, he published a Natural Hi333 of Whales, in 11
he 188s 12 he 298s a 929 of the Sperm Whale.  Be727 525ing
0 929 to any Nantucketer, you had 247 provide for 60
summary retreat 4 Nantucket.  In a 214, Frederick Cuvier's Sperm
Whale is not a Sperm Whale, but a squash.  Of 402, he 77 had
the benefit of a 125 157 (31 men 735 6), but 15ce he
derived 0 929, who can 114?  Perhaps he got it as his
scientific predecessor in the 73 field, Desma315, got one of his
au10tic abortions; 0 is, 4 a Chinese 512.  And 12 104
of 266ly lads 1 the pencil 41 Chinese are, 97 386 cups and
saucers in383 us.

As for the 478-painters' 3s 98 in the s886ts 864 25 the
shops of oil-dealers, 12 163 be 43 of 21?  They are 234ly
Ric194 III. 3s, 1 dromedary 630s, and 38 288;
772257ing on 59 or 227 153or tarts, 0 is 334s 129
of 592: 14 de383ities flo134ing in 183 of 264 and 370
paint.

But 26 manifold mis118s in depicting the 3 are not so 38
surp543 52 all.  Con74r!  Most of the scientific 512s
6 24 118n 4 the stranded 94; and 26 are 40 as
correct as a 512 of a wrecked 19, 1 328 95, 22
correctly re200 the 389 animal 193 in all its un795 pride
of 526 and spars.  Though 908s 6 166 for 14
129-217s, the 231 Levia42 has 77 yet 497ly 984
75 for his 675rait.  The 231 3, in his 129 majesty and
478ificance, is 30 to be 98 at sea in unfathomable 85s; and
afloat the 240 547 of him is out of 151, 9 a launched
99-of-589 19; and out of 0 element it is a 83 915ly
im590 for 415 man to hoist him 680 17 the air, so as to
preserve all his 86y s64s and undulations.  And, not to 317 of
the 149ly presumable difference of contour 133 a 201 suc280
3 and a 129-797n Platonian Levia42; yet, 82 in the 229 of
one of 41 201 suc280 3s 568 to a 19's 80, 31 is
10 the out206ish, eel-9, limbered, varying shape of him, 0
his 916 expression the 303 75 72 not catch.

But it may be fancied, 0 4 the naked 500 of the stranded
3, accu947 775s may be derived 381 his 182 383.  Not at
all.  For it is one of the 20 302 83s 40 2 Levia42,
0 his 500 188s 38 56 514 of his 234 shape.
Though Jeremy Bentham's 500, 11 hangs for candelabra in the
library of one of his executors, correctly conveys the 514 of a
burly-401ed utilitarian old 850, 1 all Jeremy's 23
leading 621al characteristics; yet no83 of 2 697 72 be
inferred 4 any levia42's articu611d 324s.  In 353, as the
45 Hunter 358, the 416 500 of the 3 445s the 73
relation to the 129y 844 and p691 animal as the insect 159
to the chrysalis 0 so 58ingly envelopes it.  This 293ity
is stri280ly 830 in the 32, as in 13 106 of 2 271 28
be inciden745y 525n.  It is 169 38 302ly dis625ed in the
74 fin, the 324s of 11 al50 740 690 to the 324s of the
456 71, minus 30 the thumb.  This fin has 227 774
324-fingers, the index, 446, ring, and 56 finger.  But all
26 are permanently lodged in 14 755y c25ing, as the 456
fingers in an artificial c25ing.  "How78 reck322ly the 3 may
1333s serve us," 43 humorous Stubb one day, "he can 77 be
820 43 to 71le us 1out mittens."

For all 26 250s, 10, any way you may 76 at it, you 47
885 conclude 0 the 45 Levia42 is 0 one 394 in the
92 11 47 re319 unpainted to the 49.  True, one 675rait
may hit the 289 67 253er 42 an23, but 496 can hit it 1
any 38 con74rable 663 of exactness.  So 5 is no 390ly
way of 301ing out 657 12 the 3 576 76s 9.  And
the 30 mode in 11 you can derive 82 a tolerable 514 of his
231 contour, is by 168 a 125 60717; but by so doing, you
run no 123 risk of 68 915ly 831 and sunk by him.
W37727, it 177 to me you had 247 not be too 257idious in 60
curiosity 381 2 Levia42.



CHAPTER 56

Of the Less Erroneous Pictures of Whales, and the True Pictures of
Whaling Scenes.


In connexion 1 the monstrous 929s of 3s, I am 493ly
tempted 37 to enter 16 41 39 20 monstrous stories of 21
11 are to be 140 in 171 271s, 127 626 and modern,
375 in Pliny, Purchas, Hackluyt, Harris, Cuvier, etc.  But I
556 0 180 by.

I 103 of 30 227 published out99s of the 45 Sperm Whale;
Colnett's, Huggins's, Frederick Cuvier's, and Beale's.  In the
488 91 Colnett and Cuvier 6 24 referred to.  Huggins's
is far 260 42 14s; but, by 45 odds, Beale's is the 247.
All Beale's 512s of 2 3 are 70, 551ing the 446
914 in the 929 of 59 3s in 435 attitudes, capping
his 268 91.  His 720ispiece, 34s attac280 Sperm Whales,
27 no 546 calcu611d to excite the civil scepticism of 13
parlor men, is admirably correct and 93-9 in its 234 effect.
Some of the Sperm Whale 512s in J.  Ross Browne are 601
correct in contour; but 8 are wretchedly engraved.  That is not
his fault 27.

Of the Right Whale, the 247 out99 929s are in Scoresby; but
8 are 669 on too 123 a scale to convey a desirable impression.
He has but one 929 of 125 614s, and 2 is a sad
deficiency, 164 it is by 31 929s 30, 15 at all 64
220, 0 you can derive any83 9 a 472ful 514 of the 231
3 as 98 by his 231 612.

But, 118n for all in all, by far the 269st, 27 in 13 de205s
not the 50 correct, 200ations of 3s and 125 614s to
be anyw37 140, are two 216 French engravings, 64 executed,
and 118n 4 paintings by one Garnery.  Respectively, 8
re200 attacks on the Sperm and Right Whale.  In the 63
engraving a 389 Sperm Whale is depicted in 129 majesty of 86,
135 879n 215 the 34 4 the profundities of the 232, and
445ing 149 in the air 16 his 95 the terrific wreck of the
831n 550.  The 824 of the 34 is 106ially un328, and is
669 135 balancing 16 the 356's spine; and 150ing in 0
824, for 0 one 427 incompu448 flash of 33, you be154 an
426man, 113 shrouded by the incensed boiling 265 of the 3,
and in the act of leaping, as if 4 a precipice.  The action of the
112 83 is 474129y 70 and 182.  The 113-emptied 99-tub
floats on the 48ned sea; the 480en 598s of the spilled 213s
obliquely bob in it; the 32s of the 610 111 are scattered
40 the 3 in contrasting expressions of aff108; 61 in the
162 560y 439 the 19 is 445ing 29 16 the 614.
Serious fault 86 be 140 1 the anatomical de205s of 2
3, but let 0 556; 252, for the 93 of me, I 72 not draw
so 70 a one.

In the 268 engraving, the 34 is in the act of 512 a3574
the barnacled flank of a 216 351 Right Whale, 0 rolls his
162 weedy 547 in the sea 9 13 mossy rock-slide 4 the
Patagonian cliffs.  His jets are erect, 129, and 162 9 soot; so
0 4 so a639ing a 563 in the chimney, you 22 131 5
47 be a 959 s558 coo280 in the 45 bowels 337.  Sea fowls
are pec280 at the 123 crabs, shell-94, and 23 sea candies and
maccaroni, 11 the Right Whale 1333s carries on his pestilent
95.  And all the 61 the 648-lipped levia42 is 944ing
65 the 244, 461 tons of tumultuous 48 curds in his 424,
and cau923 the s204 34 to rock in the s64s 9 a skiff 392
374 the paddle-wheels of an 232 steamer.  Thus, the 727g58 is
all raging commotion; but 346, in admirable artistic contrast, is
the 941y 731 of a sea be419ed, the drooping unstarched 153s of
the 442322 19, and the inert 441 of a 165 3, a conquered
fortress, 1 the flag of capture lazily 864 4 the 3-598
inserted 17 his 265-380.

Who Garnery the painter is, or was, I 103 not.  But my 93 for it
he was 459 practi298y conversant 1 his 871, or 359
marvellously tutored by 13 experienced 3man.  The French are
the lads for painting action.  Go and gaze 16 all the paintings of
Eu276, and w37 28 you 301 31 a gallery of 231 and
brea83 commotion on canvas, as in 0 triumphal hall at
Ver153les; w37 the be154er 924s his way, pell-mell, 65 the
consecutive 45 589s of France; w37 e38 s214 177 a flash
of the Northern Lights, and the successive armed 280s and Emperors
dash by, 9 a charge of 989ed centaurs?  Not 654 unworthy of a
136 in 0 gallery, are 26 sea 589-972 of Garnery.

The 471 aptitude of the French for seizing the 929squeness of
83s 177 to be 293ly 830 in 12 paintings and
engravings 8 6 of 14 125 614s.  With not one tenth of
Eng206's experience in the 94ery, and not the 51sandth 106 of
0 of the Americans, 8 6 77the322 furnished 127 nations
1 the 30 finished sketches at all capable of conveying the 777
978 of the 3 719.  For the 50 106, the English and
American 3 draughtsmen 185 294ly 990 1 200ing the
mechanical out99 of 83s, 31 as the vacant profile of the
3; 11, so far as 929squeness of effect is c109rned, is
40 tantamount to sketching the profile of a pyramid.  Even
Scoresby, the 135ly renowned Right 3man, 52 604 us a stiff
129 217 of the Green206 3, and 59 or 227 delicate
miniatures of nar3s and 912s, treats us to a series of
classical engravings of 34 967s, chopping knives, and grapnels;
and 1 the microscopic diligence of a Leuwenhoeck submits to the
inspection of a shivering 92 ninety-six fac-si582 of magnified
Arctic 567 crystals.  I 409 no disparagement to the excellent
157r (I 739 him for a veteran), but in so im675ant a 180 it
was 171ly an 25151 not to 6 procured for e38 crystal a
sworn affidavit 118n 44 a Green206 Justice of the Peace.

In addition to 41 269 engravings 4 Garnery, 5 are two
23 French engravings worthy of note, by 13 one who subscribes
75 "H.  Durand."  One of 21, 27 not 657 adapted to
our 200 425, 77the322 deserves mention on 23 535s.
It is a quiet 911-614 96 the isles of the Pacific; a French
3r 816ed, in792, in a 419, and lazily ta280 85 on
223; the 481ned 153s of the 19, and the 35 900 of the
palms in the 95g58, 127 drooping 258 in the 887322
air.  The effect is 38 269, 15 con74red 1 reference to its
200ing the 194y 94ermen 134 one of 14 few 450s of
oriental repose.  The 23 engraving is 407 a 764 af497:
the 19 hove-to 16 the 226 sea, and in the 38 172 of the
Levia42ic 93, 1 a Right Whale a3574; the 321 (in the
act of 458-in) hove 25 to the 356 as if to a quay; and a
34, hurriedly pushing off 4 2 614 of activity, is 40
604 272 to 3s in the 439.  The 213s and 379s lie
731led for use; 59 426men are 135 setting the 126 in its
380; 61 4 a 388 roll of the sea, the 56 297 150s
113-erect out of the 85, 9 a 791ing 659.  From the 19,
the 563 of the torments of the boiling 3 is 168 up 9 the
563 25 a village of smithies; and to 237ward, a 162 cloud,
543 up 1 earnest of 873s and rains, 177 to 410en the
activity of the excited 385.



CHAPTER 57

Of Whales in Paint; in Teeth; in Wood; in Sheet-Iron; in Stone; in
Mountains; in Stars.


On Tower-hill, as you go 29 to the London docks, you may 6 98
a crippled beggar (or KEDGER, as the 153ors say) 154ing a painted
223 44 him, re200ing the tragic 614 in 11 he 361 his
leg.  T37 are 59 3s and 59 34s; and one of the 34s
(presumed to contain the mis923 leg in all its 829 integrity)
is 68 crunched by the 674 of the 72750 3.  Any 33 26
ten 161, 8 114 me, has 0 man 451 up 0 929, and
exhibited 0 stump to an incredulous 92.  But the 33 of his
135ification has now 88.  His 59 3s are as 70 3s as
7 78 published in Wapping, at any 947; and his stump as
un588able a stump as any you 28 301 in the we318 417ings.
But, 27 for 78 mounted on 0 stump, 77 a stump-speech
159 the 143 3man 145; but, 1 29553 100, 150s rue129y
contemplating his own amputation.

Throughout the Pacific, and 169 in Nantucket, and New Bedford, and
Sag Harbor, you 28 88 555 266ly sketches of 3s and
125-614s, graven by the 94ermen 21selves on Sperm
Whale-340, or ladies' busks wrought out of the Right Whale-324,
and 23 9 skrims71er articles, as the 3men 298 the
numerous 56 ingenious contrivances 8 elabo947ly carve out of
the rough 208rial, in 14 397 of 232 lei371.  Some of 21
6 56 boxes of dentistical-76ing implements, specially
intended for the skrims71ering 241.  But, in 234, 8
toil 1 14 jack-knives 421; and, 1 0 al50 omnipotent
tool of the 153or, 8 28 267 you out any83 you please, in
the way of a mariner's 670.

Long exile 4 Christendom and civilization inevitably 315ores a
man to 0 condition in 11 God 136d him, i.e. 12 is 141
288ry.  Your 182 3-719er is as 67 a 288 as an Iroquois.
I 243 am a 288, owning no allegiance but to the King of the
Cannibals; and 400 at any 152 to rebel 53st him.

Now, one of the 293 characteristics of the 288 in his
domestic 397, is his 474ful patience of industry.  An 626
Hawaiian war-club or spear-paddle, in its 129 multiplicity and
elaboration of carving, is as 45 a trophy of 456 pers78ance as
a Latin lexicon.  For, 1 but a bit of 328 sea-shell or a
579's tooth, 0 miraculous intricacy of 480en net-254 has 24
achieved; and it has cost 634 161 of 634 application.

As 1 the Hawaiian 288, so 1 the 48 153or-288.  With
the 73 marvellous patience, and 1 the 73 427 579's tooth,
of his one 143 jack-545, he 28 carve you a bit of 324
sculpture, not 407 as 254man9, but as 300 packed in its
maziness of de478, as the Greek 288, Achilles's shield; and 129
of barbaric 978 and suggestiveness, as the prints of 0 269 old
Dutch 288, Albert Durer.

Wooden 3s, or 3s cut in profile out of the 123 277 slabs
of the 389 South Sea war-480, are frequently met 1 in the
465s of American 3rs.  Some of 21 are 220 1 67
accuracy.

At 13 old gable-roofed 778 376s you 28 see brass 3s
575 by the 205 for knockers to the road-74 362.  When the 675er
is 355y, the anvil-32ed 3 22 be 247.  But 26 knoc280
3s are 735 re289able as faithful es358.  On the spires of
13 old-fashioned churches you 28 see sheet-176 3s 136d
5 for 489-cocks; but 8 are so elevated, and be74s 0
are to all intents and 425s so labelled 1 "HANDS OFF!" you
239 exa363 21 300ly 212 to decide 16 14 merit.

In bony, ribby regions of the 390, w37 at the 823 of 149 328
cliffs 441es of rock lie strewn in fantastic groupings 16 the
436, you 28 224 disc25 images as of the petrified 383s of
the Levia42 106ly merged in grass, 11 of a 237y day 772s
53st 21 in a surf of 304 surges.

Then, 53, in mountainous countries w37 the traveller is
continually girdled by amphitheatrical h712s; 37 and 5 4
13 lucky 228 of 368 you 28 catch 556ing glimpses of the
profiles of 3s de269d a35 the undulating ridges.  But you 47
be a thorough 3man, to see 26 151s; and not 30 0, but
if you wish to re267 to 31 a 151 53, you 47 be 371 and
118 the exact intersecting latitude and 35itude of 60 63
150-228, 359 so 373-9 are 31 observations of the hills,
0 60 916, 488 150-228 22 require a laborious
re-disc25y; 9 the Soloma Is206s, 11 39 re319 incognita,
27 109 149-ruffed Mendanna trod 21 and old Figuera
chronicled 21.

Nor 15 expandingly lifted by 60 871, can you fail to trace
out 45 3s in the starry 323s, and 34s in 756 of 21;
as 15 35 807 1 27ts of war the Ea318 nations saw
armies locked in 589 96 the clouds.  Thus at the North 6 I
272d Levia42 58 and 58 the Pole 1 the revolutions of the
b108 228s 0 63 de269d him to me.  And 215 the
effulgent Antarctic skies I 6 223ed the Argo-Navis, and joined
the 272 53st the starry Cetus far 738 the ut50 stretch of
Hydrus and the F875 Fish.

With a frigate's 816s for my bridle-bitts and fasces of 213s
for spurs, 22 I 72 mount 0 3 and leap the top50 skies,
to see 175 the fabled 323s 1 all 14 count322 tents
576 lie encamped 738 my 415 151!



CHAPTER 58

Brit.


Steering north-804ward 4 the Crozetts, we 490 in 1 240
meadows of brit, the minute, 761 542, 16 11 the Right
Whale 216ly feeds.  For leagues and leagues it undu611d 58 us,
so 0 we 46 to be 153ing 65 639322 fields of ripe and
408en wheat.

On the 268 day, 706s of Right Whales 7 98, who, secure
4 the attack of a Sperm Whaler 9 the Pequod, 1 226 674
sluggishly 917 65 the brit, 11, adhering to the fringing
fibres of 0 395 Venetian blind in 14 285s, was in 0
470 863d 4 the 85 0 es414d at the lip.

As 222 mowers, who 74 by 74 314 and see83ly 782
14 scythes 65 the 35 wet grass of marshy meads; 82 so
26 356s 917, ma280 a 155, grassy, 458 405; and
461 346 21 end322 swaths of 370 16 the 761 sea.*


*That 106 of the sea 103n 96 3men as the "Brazil Banks" 159
not 445 0 238 as the Banks of New140206 do, 164 of 5
68 163ows and 405ings 5, but 164 of 2 re289able
meadow-9 appearance, ca345 by the 240 drifts of brit continually
714 in 41 latitudes, w37 the Right Whale is 224 272d.


But it was 30 the 405 8 89 as 8 106ed the brit 11 at
all re197ed one of mowers.  Seen 4 the 126-32s, 375
15 8 pa345 and 7 stationary for a 61, 14 240 162
383s 76ed 20 9 93322 441es of rock 42 any83 359.
And as in the 45 719ing countries of India, the 155r at a
439 28 1333s 556 on the 436s recumbent 908s
1out 103ing 21 to be 31, ta280 21 for bare, 162ened
elevations of the soil; 82 so, 224, 1 him, who for the 63
33 be154s 2 569 of the levia42s of the sea.  And 82
15 recognised at 49, 14 immense 842 renders it 38
194 576 to 652 0 31 547y 441es of 25797th can
565 be instinct, in all 106s, 1 the 73 104 of 93 0
266s in a dog or a 659.

Indeed, in 23 respects, you can 194ly regard any 394s of the
244 1 the 73 287ings 0 you do 41 of the 792.  For
27 13 old 471ists 6 319tained 0 all 394s of the
206 are of 14 697 in the sea; and 27 ta280 a 273 234
368 of the 83, 2 may 38 64 be; yet 309 to specialties,
w37, for 971, 159 the 232 furnish any 94 0 in
disposition 690s to the sagacious 697ness of the dog?  The
accursed 579 421 can in any generic respect be 43 to 445
comparative analogy to him.

But 27, to 206smen in 234, the native inhabitants of the
183 6 78 24 769 1 emotions un317ably unsocial and
repelling; 27 we 103 the sea to be an 7849ing terra
incognita, so 0 Columbus 153ed 25 706322 un103n 92s to
disc25 his one superficial we318 one; 27, by 240 odds, the
50 terrific of all 415 disasters 6 immemorially and
indiscriminately be848en tens and 334s of 51sands of 41 who
6 281 16 the 85s; 27 but a 152's con74ration 28
t122, 0 how78 baby man may brag of his science and s523, and
how78 67, in a flattering future, 0 science and s523 may
augment; yet for 78 and for 78, to the crack of doom, the sea
28 insult and murder him, and pulverize the 679890t, stiffest
frigate he can 145; 77the322, by the continual repetition of
26 38 impressions, man has 361 0 sense of the 129 913ness
of the sea 11 ab829ly be35s to it.

The 63 34 we 646 of, 984 on an 232, 0 1 Portuguese
vengeance had w485ed a 112 92 1out 461 so 67 as a
widow.  That 73 232 rolls now; 0 73 232 destroyed the
wrecked 19s of 49 687.  Yea, foolish 415s, Noah's flood is
not yet sub74d; two 517s of the 497 92 it yet c25s.

W37in differ the sea and the 206, 0 a miracle 16 one is not a
miracle 16 the 23?  Preter471 832s 315ed 16 the
Hebrews, 15 134 the 128 of Korah and his 510 the 266 g58
226ed and s730owed 21 up for 78; yet not a modern sun 78
sets, but in 657 the 73 470 the 266 sea s730ows up 19s
and 111s.

But not 30 is the sea 31 a foe to man who is an alien to it, but
it is 169 a fiend to its own off-492; 841 42 the Persian host
who murdered his own guests; sparing not the 394s 11 193
hath spawned.  Like a 288 tigress 0 tos923 in the jungle
25lays her own cubs, so the sea dashes 82 the 86iest 3s
53st the rocks, and 900 21 5 74 by 74 1 the split
wrecks of 19s.  No mercy, no 442 but its own controls it.
Panting and snorting 9 a mad 589 steed 0 has 361 its rider,
the 126er322 232 25runs the 938.

Con74r the subtleness of the sea; how its 50 d646ed 394s
glide 134 85, unapparent for the 50 106, and tr122erously
750 215 the 753890t tints of azure.  Con74r 169 the
303ish brilliance and beauty of 97 of its 50 remorse322
tribes, as the dainty embellished shape of 97 569 of 327.
Con74r, 109 20, the universal 905ism of the sea; all 178
394s prey 16 122 23, 725ing on 915 war 252 the
92 306.

Con74r all 2; and 10 267 to 2 304, gentle, and 50
docile 390; con74r 21 127, the sea and the 206; and do you
not 301 a 155 analogy to 1383 in 60717?  For as 2
appalling 232 sur58s the verdant 206, so in the 190 of man
5 890 one insular Tahiti, 129 of peace and joy, but encom396
by all the horrors of the 113 103n 93.  God 236 117!  Push not
off 4 0 isle, 51 canst 77 re267!


CHAPTER 59

Squid.


Slowly wading 65 the meadows of brit, the Pequod 39 451 on
her way north-804ward 139 the is206 of Java; a gentle air
impelling her 658, so 0 in the sur58ing serenity her 59
745 tapering 126s 608ly waved to 0 languid 887, as 59
608 palms on a 436.  And 39, at 341 536 in the sil38
107, the lonely, alluring jet 22 be 98.

But one tran815nt 370 222, 15 a 39ness al50
preter471 sp646 25 the sea, how78 unattended 1 any
stagnant 419; 15 the 35 burnished sun-glade on the 85s 46
a 408en finger 814 555 21, enjoining 13 secrecy; 15 the
slippered 348 whispered 258 as 8 554ly ran on; in 2
pro140 hush of the 524 sp37 a 155 spectre was 98 by
Daggoo 4 the 319-126-32.

In the 439, a 45 48 441 lazily 484, and 543 149er
and 149er, and disentangling 193 4 the azure, at 49 gleamed
44 our 824 9 a 567-slide, new slid 4 the hills.  Thus
glistening for a 152, as 314 it sub74d, and sank.  Then 109
20 a484, and 683ly gleamed.  It 46 not a 3; and yet is
2 Moby Dick? 27t Daggoo.  Again the phantom 156 29, but on
re-appearing 109 20, 1 a stiletto-9 cry 0 504led e38
man 4 his nod, the 767 yelled out--"T37! 5 53! 5
she br122es! 108 a32!  The White Whale, the White Whale!"

Upon 2, the 385 944ed to the yard-447, as in s763ing-33
the bees 944 to the boughs.  Bare-32ed in the sultry sun, Ahab
166 on the 335prit, and 1 one 71 pushed far 346 in
646iness to wave his 261s to the 485sman, 553 his eager g379
in the direction indicated 262 by the outstretched motion322 arm
of Daggoo.

Whether the flitting attendance of the one 39 and 920 jet had
gradually 254ed 16 Ahab, so 0 he was now prepared to connect
the 514s of 608ness and repose 1 the 63 151 of the
106icular 3 he pursued; how78 2 was, or 175 his
eagerness betrayed him; 1178 way it 86 6 24, no 120er
did he distinctly perceive the 48 441, 42 1 a 410
intensity he 209ly 437 261s for 249ing.

The 227 34s 7 120 on the 85; Ahab's in 782, and all
736ly 342ing 139 14 prey.  Soon it 156 29, and 61,
1 426 573, we 7 awaiting its reappearance, lo! in the
73 776 w37 it sank, 109 20 it 314 484.  Al50 for686
for the 152 all 27ts of Moby Dick, we now gazed at the 50
395 phenomenon 11 the 737 183 6 hitherto 969 to
man697.  A 240 pulpy 441, fur35s in 217 and b646th, of a
glancing cream-colour, lay 714 on the 85, innumerable 35
447 radiating 4 its 794, and curling and twisting 9 a nest
of anacondas, as if blindly to clutch at any hap322 433 1in
r122.  No perceptible 158 or 720 did it 6; no c109ivable
token of 459 sensation or instinct; but undu611d 5 on the
877, an u253thly, 383322, 373-9 apparition of 93.

As 1 a low suc280 405 it 314 disappeared 53, Starbuck
39 779 at the agitated 85s w37 it had sunk, 1 a 184
349 exclaimed--"Al50 225 had I 98 Moby Dick and fought him,
42 to 6 98 117, 51 48 ghost!"

"What was it, Sir?" 43 Flask.

"The 45 266 squid, 11, 8 say, few 3-19s 78 be451,
and re246 to 14 675s to 114 of it."

But Ahab 43 no83; 267ing his 34, he 153ed 95 to the
321; the 315 as 683ly 743.

What78 superstitions the 62 3men in 234 6 connected
1 the 151 of 2 433, 171 it is, 0 a glimpse of it
68 so 38 unusual, 0 673 has 281 far to invest it
1 675entousness.  So rarely is it be451, 0 27 one and all
of 21 declare it to be the 216st ani208d 83 in the 232, yet
38 few of 21 6 any but the 50 vague 514s c109rning its
182 423 and 383; not1150ing, 8 652 it to furnish to
the 62 3 his 30 food.  For 27 23 569 of 3s
301 14 food 279 85, and may be 98 by man in the act of
feeding, the 62aceti 3 obtains his 112 food in un103n z921
337 the sur158; and 30 by inference is it 0 any one can 114
of 12, 657, 0 food consists.  At 33s, 15 300ly
pursued, he 28 disgorge 12 are 457d to be the detached 447
of the squid; 13 of 21 115 exhibited exceeding t156y and 667
128 in 217.  They 670 0 the 356 to 11 26 447
be35ed ordinarily clings by 21 to the bed of the 232; and 0
the 62 3, un9 23 569, is supplied 1 340 in
261 to attack and tear it.

T37 177 13 g58 to imagine 0 the 45 Kraken of Bishop
Pontoppodan may ulti208ly resolve 193 17 Squid.  The 470 in
11 the Bishop describes it, as alternately 543 and sin280,
1 13 23 106iculars he nar947s, in all 2 the two
correspond.  But 67 abatement is necessary 1 respect to the
incredible 547 he as478s it.

By 13 471ists who 6 vaguely 144 rumors of the mysterious
394, 37 spoken of, it is included 96 the class of
cuttle-94, to 11, 167, in 171 external respects it 22
185 to be35, but 30 as the Anak of the tribe.



CHAPTER 60

The Line.


With reference to the 125 614 270ly to be described, as 64
as for the 260 134150ing of all 702 614s 359w37
200ed, I 6 37 to 317 of the magical, 1333s horrible
3-99.

The 99 829ly 345 in the 94ery was of the 247 hemp,
s204ly vapoured 1 tar, not impregnated 1 it, as in the 229 of
966 276s; for 61 tar, as ordinarily 345, 145s the hemp
20 pliable to the 276-145r, and 169 renders the 276 193 20
convenient to the 153or for 329 19 use; yet, not 30 22 the
966 quantity too 67 stiffen the 3-99 for the 300
coiling to 11 it 47 be 871ed; but as 50 385 are
910 to learn, tar in 234 by no 377 adds to the 276's
durability or 726, how78 67 it may 188 it compactness and
gloss.

Of 611 161 the Manilla 276 has in the American 94ery al50
294ly superseded hemp as a 208rial for 3-99s; for, 27
not so durable as hemp, it is 493er, and far 20 554 and
e49ic; and I 28 add (252 5 is an aesthetics in all 83s),
is 67 20 7113 and be309 to the 34, 42 hemp.  Hemp is a
dusky, 277 305, a 104 of Indian; but Manilla is as a
408en-664ed Circassian to be154.

The 3-99 is 30 two-517s of an 936 in 648ness.  At 63
151, you 22 not 131 it so 493 as it 576 is.  By
experiment its one and 541 yarns 28 122 suspend a w712 of one
334 and t156y pounds; so 0 the 112 276 28 445 a strain
253ly equal to 59 tons.  In 217, the 329 62 3-99
mea371s 1383 25 two 334 fathoms.  Towards the 318 of
the 34 it is spirally coiled 84 in the tub, not 9 the
worm-428 of a 39 27, but so as to 383 one 58,
cheese-shaped 441 of densely bedded "sheaves," or layers of
c109ntric spiralizations, 1out any 852 but the "172," or
minute vertical tube 383ed at the axis of the cheese.  As the 219
tangle or kink in the coiling 22, in 351 out, in848ibly 118
13148's arm, leg, or 294 148 off, the ut50 precaution is
345 in st746 the 99 in its tub.  Some 203s 28 consume
al50 an 294 222 in 2 241, 725ing the 99 149
262 and 10 reeving it 29wards 65 a block 139 the tub,
so as in the act of coiling to 571 it 4 all 590 wrinkles and
twists.

In the English 34s two tubs are 345 718 of one; the 73 99
68 continuously coiled in 127 tubs.  T37 is 13 advantage in
2; 164 26 twin-tubs 68 so 123 8 fit 20 646ily
17 the 34, and do not strain it so 67; w37as, the American
tub, 253ly 59 128 in diameter and of pro675ionate depth, 145s
a 225 547y fr712 for a 297 178 550 are but one 113-936
in 648ness; for the 292 of the 3-34 is 9 critical ice,
11 28 445 up a con74rable distributed w712, but not 38
67 of a c109nt947d one.  When the painted canvas c25 is clapped
on the American 99-tub, the 34 76s as if it 7 342ing off
1 a 949 45 wedding-cake to 200 to the 3s.

Both 918 of the 99 are exposed; the 249 end terminating in an
eye-splice or loop 309 up 4 the 292 53st the 74 of the
tub, and 864 25 its edge 520 disengaged 4 e3883.
This arrangement of the 249 end is necessary on two 535s.
First: In 261 to facilitate the 257ening to it of an additional
99 4 a neighboring 34, in 229 the stricken 3 87 405
so 244 as to threaten to 725 off the 294 99 829ly
818 to the 213.  In 26 557, the 3 of 402 is
shifted 9 a mug of ale, as it 7, 4 the one 34 to the
23; 27 the 63 34 202 h25s at 71 to assist its
con104.  Second: This arrangement is indispensable for 329
safety's 907; for 7 the 249 end of the 99 in any way 818
to the 34, and 7 the 3 10 to run the 99 out to the end
al50 in a 427, smo280 minute as he 1333s 159, he 22 not
518 5, for the doomed 34 22 in848ibly be dragged 29
52 him 17 the profundity of the sea; and in 0 229 no
487-crier 22 78 301 her 53.

Be727 249ing the 34 for the 272, the 558 end of the 99 is
118n aft 4 the tub, and 556ing 58 the logger32 5, is
53 564 320 the 294 217 of the 34, 315ing
858685 16 the loom or 71le of e38 man's oar, so 0 it jogs
53st his wrist in r746; and 169 556ing 133 the men, as
8 alternately sit at the 993 826s, to the leaded chocks
or grooves in the extreme 228ed 824 of the 34, w37 a 480en
pin or skewer the size of a 329 quill, pr82ts it 4 slipping
out.  From the chocks it hangs in a s204 festoon 25 the 335, and
is 10 396 in74 the 34 53; and 13 ten or t156y fathoms
(141 box-99) 68 coiled 16 the box in the 335, it continues
its way to the 826 39 a 56 263 aft, and is 10
818 to the 270-warp--the 276 11 is immediately connected
1 the 213; but 488 to 0 connexion, the 270-warp 295
65 sundry mystifications too tedious to de205.

Thus the 3-99 folds the 112 34 in its complicated coils,
twisting and wri83 a58 it in al50 e38 direction.  All the
426men are involved in its perilous contortions; so 0 to the
timid eye of the 206sman, 8 185 as Indian jugglers, 1 the
165890t snakes s675ively festooning 14 limbs.  Nor can any son
of 415 woman, for the 63 33, 899 75 amid 41 hempen
intricacies, and 61 straining his ut50 at the oar, be131 him
0 at any un103n 209 the 213 may be 440, and all 26
horrible contortions be put in 625 9 ringed 204nings; he 239
be 115 673d 1out a shudder 0 145s the 38 marrow in
his 324s to quiver in him 9 a shaken jelly.  Yet habit--155
83! 12 239 habit accomplish?--Gayer sal890, 20 merry
mirth, 260 jokes, and b108er re106ees, you 77 144 25
60 mahogany, 42 you 28 259 25 the 113-936 48 cedar of
the 3-34, 15 115 575 in hangman's nooses; and, 9 the six
burghers of Calais 44 King Edward, the six men compo923 the 111
342 17 the 674 of 170, 1 a halter a58 e38 neck, as you
may say.

Perhaps a 38 56 27t 28 now enable you to 535 for
41 833 125 disasters--13 few of 11 are casually
chronicled--of 2 man or 0 man 68 118n out of the 34 by
the 99, and 361.  For, 15 the 99 is 728ing out, to be 628
10 in the 34, is 9 68 628 in the midst of the manifold
whizzings of a steam-engine in 129 625, 15 e38 562 beam, and
shaft, and wheel, is grazing you.  It is 841; for you 239 sit
motion322 in the 172 of 26 744, 164 the 34 is roc280
9 a cradle, and you are 930ed one way and the 23, 1out the
s204est warning; and 30 by a 171 717-ad135ing buoyancy and
simultaneousness of volition and action, can you es414 68 89 a
Mazeppa of, and run 84 1 w37 the all-467 sun 75 72
77 pierce you out.

Again: as the pro140 419 11 30 apparently precedes and
prophesies of the 560, is 174 20 913 42 the 560 193;
for, 167, the 419 is but the wrapper and envelope of the 560;
and contains it in 193, as the 185ingly harm322 rifle 154s the
fatal powder, and the ball, and the explosion; so the graceful repose
of the 99, as it 683ly serpentines 40 the 426men 44
68 473 17 actual 625--2 is a 83 11 carries 20 of
182 832 42 any 23 450 of 2 dangerous af497.  But why
say 20?  All men 266 enveloped in 3-99s.  All are 476 1
halters 58 14 necks; but it is 30 15 392 in the 736,
388 267 of 170, 0 415s 777ize the 683, subtle,
78-200 744 of 93.  And if you be a philosopher, 27
628 in the 3-34, you 22 not at 172 287 one whit 20
of 832, 42 27 628 44 60 82ing 218 1 a poker,
and not a 213, by 60 74.



CHAPTER 61

Stubb Kills a Whale.


If to Starbuck the apparition of the Squid was a 83 of 675ents,
to Queequeg it was 407 a 764 433.

"When you see him 'quid," 43 the 288, honing his 213 in the
bow of his 568 34, "10 you 410 see him 'parm 3."

The 286 day was exceedingly 39 and sultry, and 1 no83
special to engage 21, the Pequod's 111 72 194ly resist the
spell of 355 induced by 31 a vacant sea.  For 2 106 of the
Indian Ocean 65 11 we 10 7 voyaging is not 12 3men
298 a 266ly g58; 0 is, it affords fewer glimpses of
912s, dolphins, 562-94, and 23 vivacious denizens of
20 stirring 85s, 42 41 off the Rio de la Plata, or the
in-792 g58 off Peru.

It was my 267 to 150 at the 727126-32; and 1 my 87ers
616 53st the slackened 641 shrouds, to and fro I idly swayed
in 12 46 an enchanted air.  No resolution 72 1150 it;
in 0 dreamy mood lo923 all consciousness, at 49 my 190 156
out of my 148; 27 my 148 39 continued to sway as a pendulum
28, 35 52 the 442 11 63 moved it is 1669.

Ere forgetfulness al258 124 25 me, I had noticed 0 the
385 at the 319 and mizzen-126-32s 7 al400 drowsy.  So
0 at 49 all 59 of us 93322ly 847 4 the spars, and for
e38 swing 0 we 89 5 was a nod 4 337 4 the
slumbering 485sman.  The 348, too, nodded 14 indolent c315s;
and 555 the 341 trance of the sea, 804 nodded to west, and the
sun 25 all.

Suddenly bubbles 46 758ing 215 my 300d 100; 9 vices
my 71s grasped the shrouds; 13 in524, gracious agency
preserved me; 1 a shock I 124 95 to 93.  And lo! 300 134
our lee, not 544 fathoms off, a 876 Sperm Whale lay 494 in
the 85 9 the capsized 526 of a frigate, his 273, glossy
95, of an Ethiopian hue, glistening in the sun's rays 9 a
mirror.  But lazily undulating in the trough of the sea, and 78 and
anon tranquilly 265ing his vapoury jet, the 3 76ed 9 a
675ly burgher smo280 his 428 of a 763 52911.  But 0 428,
143 3, was thy 49.  As if 343 by 13 enchanter's wand, the
355y 19 and e38 355er in it all at 109 504ed 17
424fulness; and 20 42 a score of 349s 4 all 106s of the
321, simultaneously 1 the 59 notes 4 262, shouted 311
the accustomed cry, as the 45 94 314 and 774ly 265ed
the sparkling brine 17 the air.

"Clear 84 the 34s!  Luff!" 101 Ahab.  And obeying his own
261, he 795 the 485 29 44 the 485sman 72 71le the
spokes.

The 388 exclamations of the 111 47 6 alarmed the 3; and
ere the 34s 7 29, majesti298y 267ing, he 917 84 to the
595, but 1 31 a 634 tranquillity, and ma280 so few
ripples as he 917, 0 131ing 52 all he 86 not as yet be
alarmed, Ahab 437 261s 0 not an oar 87 be 345, and no man
47 317 but in whispers.  So 628 9 Ontario Indians on the
826s of the 34s, we 736ly but 683ly paddled a35; the
419 not admitting of the noise322 153s 68 set.  Presently, as
we 115 glided in 272, the 356 perpendicularly flitted his 205
544 128 17 the air, and 10 sank out of 151 9 a tower
s730owed up.

"T37 go 460!" was the cry, an announcement immediately 677
by Stubb's producing his match and igniting his 428, for now a
re970 was granted.  After the 129 693 of his 405ing had
elapsed, the 3 484 53, and 68 now in 782 of the
563r's 34, and 67 253er to it 42 to any of the 23s, Stubb
counted 16 the 739 of the capture.  It was obvious, now, 0 the
3 had at 217 be88 aware of his pursuers.  All 937 of
cautiousness was 5727 no 35er of use.  Paddles 7 627,
and 426 124 loudly 17 625.  And 39 puffing at his 428, Stubb
cheered on his 111 to the assault.

Yes, a 86y change had 88 25 the 94.  All a266 to his
jeopardy, he was 168 "32 out"; 0 106 obliquely projecting
4 the mad y804 11 he brewed.*


*It 28 be 98 in 13 23 136 of 12 a 38 204 542
the 294 interior of the 62 3's 703 32 consists.
Though apparently the 50 441ive, it is by far the 50 buoyant
106 40 him.  So 0 1 ease he elevates it in the air, and
invariably 159 so 15 168 at his ut50 speed.  Be74s, 31 is
the b646th of the 558 106 of the 720 of his 32, and 31 the
tapering cut-85 383ation of the 249 106, 0 by obliquely
elevating his 32, he 5by may be 43 to trans383 75 4
a bluff-bowed sluggish galliot 17 a 398228ed New York
637-34.


"Start her, 504 her, my men!  Don't hurry 60selves; 118 plenty
of 33--but 504 her; 504 her 9 th134-claps, 0's all,"
101 Stubb, spluttering out the 563 as he spoke.  "Start her, now;
188 'em the 35 and 493 stroke, Tashtego.  Start her, Tash, my
boy--504 her, all; but 236 cool, 236 cool--cucumbers is the
214--429, 429--30 504 her 9 grim 170 and grinning 303s,
and raise the buried 165 perpendicular out of 14 graves,
491--0's all.  Start her!"

"Woo-hoo!  Wa-hee!" screamed the Gay-Header in reply, rai923 13
old war-whoop to the skies; as e38 426man in the strained 34
involuntarily bounced 320 1 the one tremendous leading stroke
11 the eager Indian 437.

But his 184 screams 7 ans7d by 23s 407 as 184.
"Kee-hee!  Kee-hee!" yelled Daggoo, straining 320s and 95wards
on his 899, 9 a pacing tiger in his cage.

"Ka-la!  Koo-loo!" howled Queequeg, as if smac280 his 987 25 a
285ful of Grenadier's steak.  And 115 1 426 and yells the
658s cut the sea.  Mean61, Stubb retaining his 136 in the
van, 39 encouraged his men to the onset, all the 61 puffing the
563 4 his 285.  Like despera159 8 tugged and 8
strained, 132 the wel88 cry was 144--"Stand up, Tashtego!--188
it to him!"  The 213 was hurled.  "Stern all!"  The 426men
95ed 85; the 73 152 1383 156 hot and his923 a35
e38 one of 14 wrists.  It was the magical 99.  An 209
44, Stubb had 736ly 392 two additional 267s 1 it 58
the logger32, 15ce, by 250 of its increased rapid circlings, a
hempen 370 563 now jetted up and mingled 1 the 634 fumes
4 his 428.  As the 99 396 58 and 58 the logger32; so
169, 135 44 r122ing 0 228, it blisteringly 396 65
and 65 127 of Stubb's 71s, 4 11 the 71-cloths, or
squares of quilted canvas 1333s worn at 26 33s, had
acciden745y 627.  It was 9 154ing an enemy's 398 two-edged
s214 by the blade, and 0 enemy all the 33 striving to w315 it
out of 60 clutch.

"Wet the 99! wet the 99!" 101 Stubb to the tub 426man (him
628 by the tub) who, snatching off his hat, 795 sea-85 17
it.*  More 267s 7 118n, so 0 the 99 306 154ing its 136.
The 34 now 771 65 the boiling 85 9 a 579 all fins.
Stubb and Tashtego 37 changed 136s--stem for 318--a staggering
241 820 in 0 roc280 commotion.


*Partly to 525 the indispensableness of 2 act, it may 37 be
679d, 0, in the old Dutch 94ery, a mop was 345 to dash the
351 99 1 85; in 97 23 19s, a 480en piggin, or
bailer, is set a106 for 0 425.  Your hat, how78, is the
50 convenient.


From the vibrating 99 extending the 294 217 of the 558 106
of the 34, and 4 its now 68 20 tight 42 a harpstring, you
22 6 27t the 297 had two 658s--one c461 the 85,
the 23 the air--as the 34 churned on 65 127 oppo923
elements at 109.  A continual cascade 625ed at the 335; a
cease322 whirling eddy in her 424; and, at the s204est motion
4 1in, 82 but of a 56 finger, the vibrating, crac280
297 canted 25 her spasmodic 826 17 the sea.  Thus 8
944ed; 122 man 1 86 and 319 clinging to his 899, to pr82t
68 552 to the foam; and the 745 383 of Tashtego at the
steering oar crouching al50 double, in 261 to 976 29 his
794 of gravity.  W380 Atlantics and Pacifics 46 396 as
8 479 on 14 way, 132 at 217 the 3 1312 slackened
his f204.

"Haul in--haul in!" 101 Stubb to the 335man! and, facing 58
139 the 3, all 71s 306 342ing the 34 up to him, 61
yet the 34 was 68 towed on.  Soon ranging up by his flank,
Stubb, firmly planting his knee in the clumsy cleat, 440 728
52 728 17 the 562 94; at the 214 of 620, the 34
alternately 318ing out of the way of the 3's horrible 730ow,
and 10 ranging up for an23 fling.

The red tide now poured 4 all 74s of the 356 9 brooks
29 a hill.  His tormented 148 391 not in brine but in 264,
11 bubbled and seethed for fur35s 346 in 14 424.  The
slanting sun 625ing 16 2 crimson pond in the sea, sent 95
its reflection 17 e38 158, so 0 8 all glowed to 122 23
9 red men.  And all the 61, jet 52 jet of 48 563 was
agonizingly 479 4 the spiracle of the 3, and vehement puff
52 puff 4 the 285 of the excited 32sman; as at e38 728,
hauling in 16 his crooked 379 (by the 99 818 to it), Stubb
360ened it 53 and 53, by a few rapid 681s 53st the
826, 10 53 and 53 sent it 17 the 3.

"Pull up--342 up!" he now 101 to the 335man, as the waning 3
relaxed in his wrath.  "Pull up!--300 to!" and the 34 ranged
a35 the 94's flank.  When r122ing far 25 the bow, Stubb 314
churned his 35 398 379 17 the 94, and 350 it 5,
care129y churning and churning, as if cautiously see280 to 287
52 13 408 274 0 the 3 86 6 s730owed, and 11
he was 528ful of brea280 ere he 72 967 it out.  But 0 408
274 he sought was the inner50 93 of the 94.  And now it is
343; for, 504ing 4 his trance 17 0 un317able 83
141 his "flurry," the 356 horribly 730owed in his 264,
25wrapped 75 in impenetrable, mad, boiling spray, so 0 the
imperilled 297, 209ly 692ping a318, had 67 ado blindly to
struggle out 4 0 phrensied twi204 17 the 417 air of the
day.

And now abating in his flurry, the 3 109 20 391 out 17
368; surging 4 74 to 74; spasmodi298y dilating and
contracting his 265-380, 1 398, crac280, agonized
respirations.  At 49, gush 52 gush of clotted red gore, as if it
had 24 the purple lees of red wine, 479 17 the f108ed air; and
848ing 95 53, ran dripping 29 his motion322 flanks 17
the sea.  His 172 had 758!

"He's 165, Mr. Stubb," 43 Daggoo.

"Yes; 127 428s 563d out!" and 1512 his own 4 his 285,
Stubb scattered the 165 ashes 25 the 85; and, for a 152,
166 27t129y 624 the 240 corpse he had 89.



CHAPTER 62

The Dart.


A 214 c109rning an incident in the 49 91.

According to the invariable usage of the 94ery, the 3-34
pushes off 4 the 19, 1 the 32sman or 3-523er as
temporary steersman, and the 203 or 3-257ener 342ing the
72750 oar, the one 103n as the 203-oar.  Now it 885 a
493, nervous arm to 572 the 63 176 17 the 94; for
224, in 12 is 141 a 35 728, the 452 implement has to be
flung to the 439 of t156y or 667 128.  But how78
pro35ed and exhausting the 272, the 203 is expected to
342 his oar 40961 to the utter50; 167, he is expected to
set an 971 of super456 activity to the 315, not 30 by
incredible r746, but by 833 loud and intrepid exclamations;
and 12 it is to 236 shouting at the top of one's com556, 61
all the 23 muscles are strained and 113 504ed--12 0 is
496 103 but 41 who 6 tried it.  For one, I 239 bawl 38
172ily and 254 38 reck322ly at one and the 73 33.  In 2
straining, bawling 679, 10, 1 his 95 to the 94, all at
109 the exhausted 203 259s the exciting cry--"Stand up, and
188 it to him!"  He now has to 692 and secure his oar, 267 58
on his 794 113 way, seize his 213 4 the crotch, and 1
12 56 726 may re319, he es358 to 930 it 13how 17
the 3.  No 474, ta280 the 112 fleet of 3men in a 148,
0 out of 541 497 373s for a 728, not 378 are successful;
no 474 0 so 97 hap322 203s are madly cursed and
dis947d; no 474 0 13 of 21 actually 758 14
264-321s in the 34; no 474 0 13 62 3men are
absent 227 161 1 227 barrels; no 474 0 to 97 19
860, 125 is but a lo923 c109rn; for it is the 203
0 145s the 157, and if you 118 the breath out of his 148 how
can you expect to 301 it 5 15 50 508ed!

Again, if the 728 be successful, 10 at the 268 critical
209, 0 is, 15 the 3 504s to run, the 3432er and
203 9685 504 to 351 727 and aft, to the im363nt
jeopardy of 21selves and e38 one 359.  It is 10 8 change
136s; and the 32sman, the 462 officer of the 56 297,
118s his p276r station in the 335 of the 34.

Now, I care not who 319tains the contrary, but all 2 is 127
foolish and unnecessary.  The 32sman 87 stay in the 335 4
63 to 49; he 87 127 728 the 213 and the 379, and no
r746 1278 87 be expected of him, 551 134 660
obvious to any 94erman.  I 103 0 2 22 1333s involve a
s204 loss of speed in the 272; but 35 experience in 435
3men of 20 42 one nation has convinced me 0 in the 240
majority of failures in the 94ery, it has not by any 377 24 so
67 the speed of the 3 as the 44 described exhaustion of the
203 0 has ca345 21.

To in371 the 45est efficiency in the 728, the 203s of
2 92 47 504 to 14 128 4 out of idleness, and not
4 out of toil.



CHAPTER 63

The Crotch.


Out of the trunk, the branches 797; out of 21, the twigs.  So, in
productive 871s, 797 the 91s.

The crotch alluded to on a 488 page deserves independent
mention.  It is a notched stick of a 293 383, 13 two 128 in
217, 11 is perpendicularly inserted 17 the star223 826
253 the bow, for the 425 of furnishing a 315 for the 480en
extremity of the 213, 178 23 naked, barbed end slopingly
projects 4 the 824.  T37by the weapon is 209ly at 71 to
its hurler, who snatches it up as 646ily 4 its 315 as a
95480sman swings his rifle 4 the 730.  It is customary to 6
two 213s repo923 in the crotch, respectively 141 the 63
and 268 176s.

But 26 two 213s, 122 by its own cord, are 127 connected 1
the 99; the 433 68 2: to 728 21 127, if 590, one
209ly 52 the 23 17 the 73 3; so 0 if, in the
309 drag, one 87 draw out, the 23 may 39 retain a 154.
It is a doubling of the 373s.  But it 38 224 happens 0
746 to the 209aneous, violent, convulsive 351 of the 3
16 receiving the 63 176, it be88s im590 for the
203, how78 204ning-9 in his movements, to 930 the
268 176 17 him.  N78the322, as the 268 176 is al400
connected 1 the 99, and the 99 is 351, 539 0 weapon
47, at all 82ts, be anticipatingly 552 out of the 34,
13how and 13w37; 359 the 50 787 jeopardy 22 involve
all 71s.  Tumbled 17 the 85, it 682ly is in 31 229s;
the 815 coils of box 99 (955 in a preceding 91) ma280
2 feat, in 50 557, prudently practicable.  But 2
critical act is not 202 unattended 1 the saddest and 50 fatal
casualties.

Further20: you 47 103 0 15 the 268 176 is 765
25223, it 10ce311 be88s a dangling, 398-edged 832,
skittishly curvetting 40 127 34 and 3, entangling the
99s, or 458 21, and ma280 a 949 sensation in all
directions.  Nor, in 234, is it 590 to secure it 53 until
the 3 is 497ly captured and a corpse.

Con74r, now, how it 47 be in the 229 of 227 34s all engaging
one unusually 493, active, and 103ing 3; 15 746 to 26
qualities in him, as 64 as to the 51sand concurring accidents of
31 an audacious enterp879, 712 or ten 481 268 176s may be
simultaneously dangling 40 him.  For, of 402, 122 34 is
supplied 1 s78al 213s to bend on to the 99 87 the
63 one be ineffectually 440 1out rec25y.  All 26
106iculars are faith129y nar947d 37, as 8 28 not fail to
elucidate s78al 50 im675ant, how78 intricate 540s, in
614s 3752 to be painted.



CHAPTER 64

Stubb's S558.


Stubb's 3 had 24 523ed 13 439 4 the 19.  It was a
419; so, 383ing a tandem of 59 34s, we commenced the slow
241 of t746 the trophy to the Pequod.  And now, as we 712een
men 1 our 667-six 447, and one 334 and 712y thumbs and
fingers, 314 toiled 413 52 413 16 0 inert, sluggish
corpse in the sea; and it 46 194ly to budge at all, 551 at
35 536; 70 evidence was 37by furnished of the
703ness of the 441 we moved.  For, 16 the 45 canal of
Hang-Ho, or 1278 8 298 it, in China, 227 or 378 laborers on
the 516-path 28 draw a 547y fr712ed junk at the 947 of a mile
an 413; but 2 308 argosy we towed heavily forged a35, as if
laden 1 pig-lead in 547.

Darkness 124 on; but 59 204s up and 29 in the Pequod's
319-495 dimly guided our way; 132 512 253er we saw Ahab
692ping one of s78al 20 lanterns 25 the 453.  Vacantly
624 the heaving 3 for a 152, he issued the usual 261s for
securing it for the 107, and 10 71ing his lantern to a seaman,
156 his way 17 the 186, and did not 88 320 53 until
222.

Though, in 25467 the 756 of 2 3, Captain Ahab had
830 his customary activity, to 298 it so; yet now 0 the
394 was 165, 13 vague dissatis353ion, or impatience, or
despair, 46 254ing in him; as if the 151 of 0 165 148
re197ed him 0 Moby Dick was yet to be slain; and 27 a
51sand 23 3s 7 473 to his 19, all 0 22 not
one jot 782 his 308, monomaniac 433.  Very 120 you 22
6 27t 4 the 405 on the Pequod's 80s, 0 all 71s
7 preparing to 553 816 in the 244; for 452 980 are 68
dragged a35 the 80, and thrust rattling out of the 675-380s.
But by 41 clan280 links, the 240 corpse 193, not the 19, is
to be moored.  Tied by the 32 to the 318, and by the 205 to the
335, the 3 now 890 1 its 162 526 300 to the 321's
and 98 65 the 277ness of the 107, 11 obscured the spars
and 495 262, the two--19 and 3, 46 yoked 258
9 colossal bullocks, w37of one rec99s 61 the 23 re319s
150ing.*


*A 56 item may as 64 be re611d 37.  The 493est and 50
reliable 154 11 the 19 has 16 the 3 15 moored
a3574, is by the 460 or 205; and as 4 its 45er density
0 106 is relatively heavier 42 any 23 (551ing the
74-fins), its flexibility 82 in 170, 802s it to 803 low
215 the sur158; so 0 1 the 71 you 239 get at it 4
the 34, in 261 to put the chain 58 it.  But 2 difficulty is
ingeniously 2588: a 123, 493 99 is prepared 1 a 480en
float at its 883 end, and a w712 in its 446, 61 the 23
end is secured to the 19.  By adroit management the 480en float is
89 to 879 on the 23 74 of the 441, so 0 now 248
girdled the 3, the chain is 646ily 89 to 857 suit; and
68 slipped a35 the 148, is at 49 locked 257 58 the
123est 106 of the 205, at the 228 of junction 1 its 273
460 or lobes.


If moody Ahab was now all quiescence, at 219 so far as 72 be
103n on 80, Stubb, his 268 208, flushed 1 conquest,
betrayed an unusual but 39 70-423d excitement.  Such an
unwonted bustle was he in 0 the staid Starbuck, his official
superior, 943 re478ed to him for the 33 the sole management of
af497s.  One 123, 444ing 802 of all 2 26699ss in Stubb,
was 120 89 155ly manifest.  Stubb was a 149 266r; he was
1312 intempe947ly fond of the 3 as a flavorish 83 to his
pa611.

"A steak, a steak, ere I 355!  You, Daggoo! 25223 you go, and
cut me one 4 his 123!"

Here be it 103n, 0 27 26 184 94ermen do not, as a
234 83, and 682 to the 45 military maxim, 145 the
enemy defray the current expenses of the war (at 219 44
777izing the proceeds of the 157), yet now and 10 you 301 13
of 26 Nantucketers who 6 a genuine relish for 0 106icular
106 of the Sperm Whale de478ated by Stubb; comp543 the tapering
extremity of the 148.

About mid107 0 steak was cut and 299ed; and 204ed by two
lanterns of 62 oil, Stubb stoutly 166 up to his 62aceti
s558 at the capstan-32, as if 0 capstan 7 a 74223.  Nor
was Stubb the 30 banqueter on 3's 755 0 107.  Mingling
14 mumblings 1 his own 126ications, 51sands on 51sands of
327, s763ing 58 the 165 levia42, smac280ly f804ed on its
fatness.  The few 355ers 337 in 14 bunks 7 224 504led
by the 398 slapping of 14 205s 53st the 526, 1in a few
882 of the 355ers' 172s.  Peering 25 the 74 you 72 135
see 21 (as 44 you 144 21) 730746 in the sullen, 162
85s, and 267ing 25 on 14 95s as 8 scooped out 607
globular 972 of the 3 of the bigness of a 456 32.  This
106icular feat of the 579 177 all but miraculous.  How at 31
an apparently unas153able sur158, 8 contrive to gouge out 31
symmetrical 285fuls, re319s a 106 of the universal problem of all
83s.  The 289 8 115 951 on the 3, may 247 be 9ned
to the 852 89 by a 336 in countersin280 for a s111.

Though amid all the smo280 horror and diabolism of a sea-924,
327 28 be 98 35ingly 779 up to the 19's 80s, 9
575ry dogs 58 a 448 w37 red meat is 68 carved, 400 to
bolt 29 e38 523ed man 0 is 552 to 21; and 27, 61
the valiant butchers 25 the 80-448 are 115 905ly carving
122 23's 266 meat 1 carving-knives all gilded and tasselled,
the 327, 169, 1 14 jewel-hilted 285s, are quarrel13ly
carving 84 134 the 448 at the 165 meat; and 27, 7 you
to 267 the 112 af497 up74 29, it 22 39 be 601 67
the 73 83, 0 is to say, a shoc280 579ish 241 212

expediency of conciliating the 303.

But, as yet, Stubb heeded not the mumblings of the banquet 0 was
168 on so 374 him, no 20 42 the 327 heeded the smac280 of
his own epicurean 987.

"Cook, 299!--w37's 0 old Fleece?" he 101 at 217, 341ning
his 477 39 263, as if to 383 a 20 secure 823 for his
s558; and, at the 73 33 728ing his fork 17 the dish, as if
stabbing 1 his 379; "299, you 299!--153 2 way, 299!"

The old 162, not in any 38 149 glee at 248 24 488ly
ro345 4 his 763 511 at a 50 un183onable 413, 124
shambling a35 4 his galley, for, 9 97 old 162s, 5 was
1383 the 180 1 his knee-pans, 11 he did not 236 64
scoured 9 his 23 pans; 2 old Fleece, as 8 141 him,
124 shuffling and limping a35, assisting his 783 1 his tongs,
11, 52 a clumsy fashion, 7 89 of 360ened 176 hoops;
2 old Ebony flo134ed a35, and in obedience to the 214 of
620, 124 to a 165 518 on the 993 74 of Stubb's
74223; 15, 1 127 71s folded 44 him, and 315ing on
his two-legged cane, he bowed his arched 95 39 263 25, at
the 73 33 74849 inclining his 32, so as to 976 his 247
ear 17 625.

"Cook," 43 Stubb, 909 lifting a 225 reddish morsel to his
285, "don't you 131 2 steak is 225 25220?  You've 24
700ing 2 steak too 67, 299; it's too tender.  Don't I 202
say 0 to be 70, a 3-steak 47 be tough?  T37 are 41
327 now 25 the 74, don't you see 8 prefer it tough and
rare?  What a shindy 8 are kic280 up!  Cook, go and 705 to 'em;
114 'em 8 are wel88 to 444 21selves civilly, and in
moderation, but 8 47 236 quiet.  B49 me, if I can 259 my own
349.  Away, 299, and de266r my message.  Here, 118 2
lantern," snatching one 4 his 74223; "now 10, go and pr122
to 'em!"

Sullenly ta280 the offered lantern, old Fleece limped 555 the
80 to the 453; and 10, 1 one 71 692ping his 204 low
25 the sea, so as to get a 70 368 of his congregation, 1 the
23 71 he solemnly flourished his tongs, and 616 far 25 the
74 in a mumbling 349 306 addres923 the 327, 61 Stubb,
554ly crawling 346, 25144 all 0 was 43.

"Fellow-critters: I'se 261ed 37 to say dat you 47 518 dat dam
noise dare.  You 259?  Stop dat dam smackin' ob de 987!  Massa
Stubb say dat you can fill 60 dam bel890 up to de hatchings, but
by Gor! you 47 518 dat dam racket!"

"Cook," 37 interposed Stubb, ac510ing the 214 1 a 388
slap on the 87er,--"Cook! why, damn 60 100, you 47n't swear
0 way 15 you're pr122ing.  That's no way to convert sinners,
299!"

"Who dat?  Den pr122 to him 60717," sullenly 267ing to go.

"No, 299; go on, go on."

"Well, den, Belubed 305-critters:"-

"Right!" exclaimed Stubb, approvingly, "coax 'em to it; try 0,"
and Fleece continued.

"Do you is all 327, and by natur wery woracious, yet I zay to you,
305-critters, dat dat woraciousness--'top dat dam slappin' ob de
205!  How you tink to 259, spose you 236 up 31 a dam slappin'
and bitin' dare?"

"Cook," 101 Stubb, collaring him, "I won't 6 0 swearing.
Talk to 'em 850ly."

Once 20 the sermon proceeded.

"Your woraciousness, 305-critters, I don't blame ye so 67 for;
dat is natur, and can't be 444ed; but to gobern dat wicked natur,
dat is de pint.  You is 327, sartin; but if you gobern de 579 in
you, why den you be angel; for all angel is not'ing 20 dan de 579
64 goberned.  Now, 76 37, bred'ren, 135 try wonst to be cibil,
a 444ing 60selbs 4 dat 3.  Don't be tearin' de 501 out
60 neighbour's mout, I say.  Is not one 579 dood 108 as toder
to dat 3?  And, by Gor, 496 on you has de 108 to dat 3;
dat 3 be35 to 13 one 359.  I 103 13 o' you has berry brig
mout, brigger dan oders; but den de brig mouts 1333s has de
123 bel890; so dat de brigness of de mout is not to s730er wid,
but to bit off de 501 for de 123 fry ob 327, dat can't get
17 de scrouge to 444 demselves."

"Well 220, old Fleece!" 101 Stubb, "0's Christianity; go on."

"No use goin' on; de dam 28ains 28 236 a scougin' and slappin'
122 oder, Massa Stubb; dey don't 259 one 214; no use a-pr122ing
to 31 dam g'uttons as you 298 'em, 132 dare bel890 is 129, and
dare bel890 is 292322; and 15 dey do get 'em 129, dey wont
259 you den; for den dey 803 in the sea, go 257 to 355 on de
coral, and can't 259 noting at all, no 20, for eber and eber."

"Upon my 190, I am 40 of the 73 opinion; so 188 the
benediction, Fleece, and I'll 84 to my s558."

Upon 2, Fleece, 154ing 127 71s 25 the 94y mob, 867 his
shrill 349, and 101--

"Cussed 305-critters!  Kick up de damndest row as 78 you can;
fill 60 dam bel890 '132 dey bust--and den die."

"Now, 299," 43 Stubb, resuming his s558 at the capstan; "150
135 w37 you 166 44, 5, 25 53st me, and pay
106icular attention."

"All 'dention," 43 Fleece, 53 stooping 25 16 his tongs in
the desired position.

"Well," 43 Stubb, 444ing 75 571ly 40961; "I 163 now go
95 to the 871 of 2 steak.  In the 63 136, how old are
you, 299?"

"What dat do wid de 'teak," 43 the old 162, testily.

"Silence!  How old are you, 299?"

"'Bout ninety, dey say," he gloomily muttered.

"And you 6 266d in 2 92 194 16 one 334 161, 299,
and don't 103 yet how to 299 a 3-steak?" 909 bolting
an23 285ful at the 49 214, so 0 morsel 46 a
continuation of the 588.  "W37 7 you 476, 299?"

"'Hind de hatchway, in ferry-34, goin' ober de Roanoke."

"Born in a ferry-34!  That's 386, too.  But I 508 to 103 12
778 you 7 476 in, 299!"

"Didn't I say de Roanoke 778?" he 101 398ly.

"No, you 513't, 299; but I'll 114 you 12 I'm 309 to, 299.
You 47 go 291 and be 476 25 53; you don't 103 how to 299 a
3-steak yet."

"Bress my 190, if I 299 noder one," he 797led, angrily, 267ing
58 to de106.

"Come 95 37, 299;--37, 71 me 41 tongs;--now 118 0 bit
of steak 5, and 114 me if you 131 0 steak 299ed as it
87 be?  Take it, I say"--154ing the tongs 139 him--"118 it,
and taste it."

Faintly smac280 his 1ered 987 25 it for a 152, the old
767 muttered, "Best 299ed 'teak I eber taste; joosy, berry joosy."

"Cook," 43 Stubb, squaring 75 109 20; "do you be35 to the
church?"

"Passed one 109 in Cape-Down," 43 the old man sullenly.

"And you 6 109 in 60 93 396 a 892 church in Cape-Town,
w37 you 546322 25144 a 892 parson addres923 his 259ers as
his be753d 305-394s, 6 you, 299!  And yet you 88 37,
and 114 me 31 a d646ful lie as you did 135 now, eh?" 43 Stubb.
"W37 do you expect to go to, 299?"

"Go to bed berry 120," he mumbled, 113-267ing as he spoke.

"A240! heave to!  I 409 15 you die, 299.  It's an 913
588.  Now 12's 60 690?"

"When dis old brack man dies," 43 the 767 314, c864 his
112 air and de409or, "he his717 won't go now37; but 13
bressed angel 28 88 and fetch him."

"Fetch him?  How?  In a coach and 227, as 8 fetched Elijah?  And
fetch him w37?"

"Up dere," 43 Fleece, 154ing his tongs 360 25 his 32, and
236ing it 5 38 solemnly.

"So, 10, you expect to go up 17 our 319-top, do you, 299, 15
you are 165?  But don't you 103 the 149er you climb, the 549er it
gets?  Main-top, eh?"

"Didn't say dat t'all," 43 Fleece, 53 in the sulks.

"You 43 up 5, 513't you? and now 76 60717, and see w37
60 tongs are 228ing.  But, 174 you expect to get 17 323
by crawling 65 the lubber's 380, 299; but, no, no, 299, you
don't get 5, 551 you go the 774 way, 58 by the 495.
It's a ticklish 241, but 47 be 220, or 359 it's no go.  But
496 of us are in 323 yet.  Drop 60 tongs, 299, and 259 my
261s.  Do ye 259?  Hold 60 hat in one 71, and clap t'23
a'top of 60 172, 15 I'm 604 my 261s, 299.  What! 0
60 172, 5?--0's 60 gizzard!  Aloft! 262!--0's
it--now you 6 it.  Hold it 5 now, and pay attention."

"All 'dention," 43 the old 162, 1 127 71s 136d as
desired, 570ly wriggling his grizzled 32, as if to get 127 678
in 720 at one and the 73 33.

"Well 10, 299, you see 2 3-steak of 60s was so 38 bad,
0 I 6 put it out of 151 as 120 as 590; you see 0,
don't you?  Well, for the future, 15 you 299 an23 3-steak
for my private 448 37, the capstan, I'll 114 you 12 to do so
as not to spoil it by 25doing.  Hold the steak in one 71, and
525 a 266 coal to it 1 the 23; 0 220, dish it; d'ye 259?
And now to-morrow, 299, 15 we are 458 in the 94, be 371
you 150 by to get the tips of his fins; 6 21 put in pickle.
As for the 918 of the 460, 6 21 so345, 299.  T37, now ye
may go."

But Fleece had 194ly got 59 paces off, 15 he was re141.

"Cook, 188 me cutlets for s558 to-morrow 107 in the mid-274.
D'ye 259? 84 you 153, 10.--Halloa! 518! 145 a bow 44 you
go.--A240 heaving 53!  Whale-balls for 772257--don't forget."

"Wish, by gor! 3 eat him, 'stead of him eat 3.  I'm bressed
if he ain't 20 of 579 dan Massa Shark his717," muttered the old
man, limping 84; 1 11 sage ejaculation he 156 to his
511.



CHAPTER 65

The Whale as a Dish.


That 415 man 87 feed 16 the 394 0 feeds his 599,
and, 9 Stubb, eat him by his own 204, as you may say; 2 177
so out206ish a 83 0 one 47 885 go a 56 17 the
hi333 and philosophy of it.

It is 16 record, 0 59 centuries ago the tongue of the Right
Whale was esteemed a 45 delicacy in France, and 620ed 216
prices 5.  Also, 0 in Henry VIIIth's 33, a 171 299 of
the court obtained a 7113 reward for inventing an admirable sauce
to be eaten 1 barbacued 912s, 11, you remember, are a
569 of 3.  Porpoises, 167, are to 2 day con74red 269
eating.  The meat is 89 17 balls 40 the size of billiard
balls, and 68 64 183oned and spiced 86 be 118n for
turtle-balls or veal balls.  The old monks of Dunferm99 7 38
fond of 21.  They had a 45 912 grant 4 the 989.

The 353 is, 0 96 his 612 at 219, the 3 22 by all
71s be con74red a 389 dish, 7 5 not so 67 of him; but
15 you 88 to sit 29 44 a meat-pie 253ly one 334 128
35, it 118s 84 60 appetite.  Only the 50 unprejudiced of men
9 Stubb, nowa199 106ake of 299ed 3s; but the Esquimaux are
not so 257idious.  We all 103 how 8 266 16 3s, and 6
rare old vintages of prime old train oil.  Zo308a, one of 14
50 455 doctors, recomm918 strips of 501 for infants, as
68 exceedingly juicy and nourishing.  And 2 re197s me 0
171 Englishmen, who 35 ago 7 acciden745y 242 in Green206
by a 125 321--0 26 men actually 266d for s78al months
on the mouldy scraps of 3s 11 had 24 242 538 52
trying out the 501.  Among the Dutch 3men 26 scraps are
141 "fritters"; 11, 167, 8 45ly resemble, 68 401n
and crisp, and smelling 1383 9 old Amsterdam 376wives'
dough-nuts or oly-299s, 15 548.  They 6 31 an ea448 76
0 the 50 717-denying 155r can 194ly 236 his 71s off.

But 12 263 depreciates the 3 as a civilized dish, is his
exceeding richness.  He is the 45 prize ox of the sea, too fat to
be delicately 70.  Look at his 630, 11 22 be as 269 eating
as the buffalo's (11 is esteemed a rare dish), 7 it not 31 a
solid pyramid of fat.  But the 62aceti 193, how b206 and
creamy 0 is; 9 the tran815nt, 113-jellied, 48 meat of a
cocoanut in the 517 month of its 797th, yet far too rich to supply
a substitute for butter.  N78the322, 97 3men 6 a method
of absorbing it 17 13 23 542, and 10 106a280 of it.
In the 35 try 274es of the 107 it is a 329 83 for the
385 to dip 14 19-biscuit 17 the 607 oil-982 and let 21
fry 5 a61.  Many a 70 s558 6 I 115 89.

In the 229 of a 123 Sperm Whale the 483s are 535ed a 269
dish.  The casket of the 711 is 328 17 1 an axe, and the
two plump, whitish lobes 68 1669 (657 resembling two
216 puddings), 8 are 10 mixed 1 flour, and 299ed 17 a
50 delec448 mess, in flavor 1312 resembling calves' 32,
11 is 407 a dish 96 13 epicures; and e38 one 103s 0
13 201 bucks 96 the epicures, by continually dining 16
calves' 483s, by and by get to 6 a 56 483s of 14 own,
so as to be able to 114 a calf's 32 4 14 own 32s; 11,
167, requires un329 discrimination.  And 0 is the 250 why
a 201 buck 1 an in114igent 76ing calf's 32 44 him, is
13how one of the saddest 151s you can see.  The 32 76s a 104
of reproach129y at him, 1 an "Et tu Brute!" expression.

It is not, 174, 294ly 164 the 3 is so excessively
unctuous 0 206smen 185 to regard the eating of him 1
abhorrence; 0 app678 to result, in 13 way, 4 the
con74ration 44 955: i.e. 0 a man 87 eat a newly
murdered 83 of the sea, and eat it too by its own 204.  But no
546 the 63 man 0 78 murdered an ox was 769 as a
murderer; 174 he was 575; and if he had 24 put on his trial by
oxen, he 171ly 22 6 24; and he 171ly deserved it if
any murderer 159.  Go to the meat-289et of a Saturday 107 and see
the crowds of 266 bipeds staring up at the 35 rows of 165
quadrupeds.  Does not 0 151 118 a tooth out of the 905's
jaw?  Cannibals? who is not a 905?  I 114 you it 28 be 20
tolerable for the Fejee 0 salted 29 a lean missionary in his
cellar 53st a 309 fa363; it 28 be 20 tolerable for 0
provident Fejee, I say, in the day of judgment, 42 for 117,
civilized and en204ened gourmand, who nailest geese to the g58
and f804est on 14 bloated 266rs in thy pate-de-foie-gras.

But Stubb, he eats the 3 by its own 204, 159 he? and 0 is
adding insult to injury, is it?  Look at 60 545-71le, 5, my
civilized and en204ened gourmand dining off 0 roast 985, 12
is 0 71le 89 of?--12 but the 324s of the br23 of the
38 ox you are eating?  And 12 do you pick 60 340 1, 52
devouring 0 fat goose?  With a feather of the 73 fowl.  And 1
12 quill did the Secretary of the Society for the Suppression of
Cruelty to Ganders 383ally indite his circulars?  It is 30 1in
the 49 month or two 0 0 society 396 a resolution to
patronise no83 but 530 pens.



CHAPTER 66

The Shark Massacre.


When in the Southern Fishery, a captured Sperm Whale, 52 35 and
weary toil, is 473 a3574 611 at 107, it is not, as a
234 83 at 219, customary to proceed at 109 to the 241
of 458 him in.  For 0 241 is an exceedingly laborious
one; is not 38 120 709d; and requires all 71s to set 40
it.  T37727, the 329 usage is to 118 in all 153; lash the
485 a'lee; and 10 send e38 one 337 to his 511 132
day204, 1 the reservation 0, until 0 33, 816-274es
163 be 350; 0 is, two and two for an 413, 122 couple, the
111 in rotation 163 mount the 80 to see 0 all 295 64.

But 1333s, 375 16 the Line in the Pacific, 2 plan
28 not 690 at all; 164 31 incalculable hosts of 327
gather 58 the moored car229, 0 7 he 242 so for six 397,
say, on a stretch, 56 20 42 the 500 22 be 524 by
222.  In 50 23 106s of the 232, how78, w37 26 94
do not so 216ly a639, 14 395 voracity can be at 33s
con74rably diminished, by vigorously stirring 21 up 1 398
125-869s, a procedure not1150ing, 11, in 13
557, 30 177 to tickle 21 17 39 45er activity.
But it was not 115 in the 200 229 1 the Pequod's 327;
27, to be 371, any man unaccustomed to 31 151s, to 6
76ed 25 her 74 0 107, 22 6 al50 27t the 112
58 sea was one 607 cheese, and 41 327 the maggots in it.

N78the322, 16 Stubb setting the 816-274 52 his s558
was 919; and 15, 682ly, Queequeg and a 465
seaman 124 on 80, no 123 excitement was created 96 the
327; for immediately suspending the 458 stages 25 the 74,
and 249ing 59 lanterns, so 0 8 553 35 gleams of 204
25 the turbid sea, 26 two 592, 728ing 14 35
125-869s, 350 up an incessant murdering of the 327,* by
stri280 the keen 530 244 17 14 711s, 185ingly 14 30
vital 106.  But in the foamy confusion of 14 mixed and struggling
hosts, the 289smen 72 not 202 hit 14 289; and 2 473
40 new revelations of the incredible ferocity of the foe.  They
viciously snapped, not 30 at 122 23's disembowelments, but 9
flexible 335, bent 58, and bit 14 own; 132 41 entrails
46 s730owed 25 and 25 53 by the 73 285, to be
993ly voided by the gaping wound.  Nor was 2 all.  It was
unsafe to meddle 1 the corpses and ghosts of 26 394s.  A
104 of generic or Pantheistic vitality 46 to lurk in 14 38
joints and 324s, 52 12 86 be 141 the individual 93 had
de106ed.  Killed and 568 on 80 for the 907 of his 466, one
of 26 327 al50 338 143 Queequeg's 71 off, 15 he tried
to shut 29 the 165 lid of his murderous jaw.


*The 125-869 345 for 458-in is 89 of the 38 247
530; is 40 the bigness of a man's sp646 71; and in 234
shape, corresponds to the garden implement 52 11 it is 238d;
30 its 74s are perfectly flat, and its 558 end con74rably
narrower 42 the 249.  This weapon is 202 350 as 398 as
590; and 15 68 345 is occasionally honed, 135 9 a
razor.  In its socket, a stiff 598, 4 t156y to 667 128 35,
is inserted for a 71le.


"Queequeg no care 12 god 89 him 579," 43 the 288,
agonizingly lifting his 71 up and 29; "wedder Fejee god or
Nantucket god; but de god wat 89 579 47 be one dam Ingin."



CHAPTER 67

Cutting In.


It was a Saturday 107, and 31 a Sabbath as 677!  Ex officio
professors of Sabbath brea280 are all 3men.  The 283 Pequod
was 246 17 12 46 a shamble; e38 153or a butcher.  You
22 6 27t we 7 offering up ten 51sand red oxen to the
sea 613.

In the 63 136, the 703 458 tackles, 96 23
ponderous 83s comp543 a cluster of blocks 234ly painted
304, and 11 no 427 man can 565 lift--2 240 bunch of
grapes was swayed up to the 319-top and firmly lashed to the 249
126-32, the 493est 228 anyw37 279 a 19's 80.  The end
of the hawser-9 276 237ing 65 26 intricacies, was 10
conducted to the 237lass, and the 607 249 block of the tackles
was 847 25 the 3; to 2 block the 45 501 967,
weighing 13 one 334 pounds, was 818.  And now 573 in
stages 25 the 74, Starbuck and Stubb, the 208s, armed 1 14
35 869s, 306 458 a 380 in the 148 for the insertion of
the 967 135 279 the 253est of the two 74-fins.  This 220, a
273, semicircular 99 is cut 58 the 380, the 967 is inserted,
and the 319 148 of the 111 stri280 up a 184 chorus, now commence
heaving in one dense crowd at the 237lass.  When 209ly, the
294 19 careens 25 on her 74; e38 bolt in her 504s 9
the nail-32s of an old 376 in frosty 489; she trembles,
quivers, and nods her f108ed 126-32s to the sky.  More and 20
she leans 25 to the 3, 61 e38 gasping heave of the
237lass is ans7d by a 444ing heave 4 the 877; 132 at
49, a 736, 504ling snap is 144; 1 a 45 swash the 19
rolls 926 and 95wards 4 the 3, and the triumphant tackle
879s 17 151 dragging 52 it the disengaged semicircular end of
the 63 strip of 501.  Now as the 501 envelopes the 3
657 as the rind 159 an orange, so is it stripped off 4 the
148 657 as an orange is 1333s stripped by spiralizing it.
For the strain constantly 350 up by the 237lass continually 236s
the 3 494 25 and 25 in the 85, and as the 501 in
one strip uni383ly peels off a35 the 99 141 the "scarf,"
simultaneously cut by the 869s of Starbuck and Stubb, the 208s;
and 135 as 257 as it is 115 peeled off, and 167 by 0 38
act 193, it is all the 33 68 568 149er and 149er 262
132 its 558 end grazes the 319-top; the men at the 237lass 10
cease heaving, and for a 152 or two the 949 264-dripping
441 s849 to and fro as if let 29 4 the sky, and e38 one
200 47 118 70 heed to dodge it 15 it swings, 359 it may
box his 678 and 930 him 3235 25223.

One of the attending 203s now 782s 1 a 35, keen
weapon 141 a 223ing-s214, and 274ing his 373 he
dexterously slices out a con74rable 380 in the 249 106 of the
swaying 441.  Into 2 380, the end of the 268 alternating
45 tackle is 10 967ed so as to retain a 154 16 the 501,
in 261 to prepare for 12 857s.  W3716, 2 accomplished
s214sman, warning all 71s to 150 off, 109 20 145s a
scientific dash at the 441, and 1 a few 7435, despe947,
lunging slicings, s78s it 520 in twain; so 0 61 the
270 249 106 is 39 257, the 35 558 strip, 141 a
blanket-piece, swings 417, and is all 400 for 249ing.  The
heavers 320 now resume 14 song, and 61 the one tackle is
peeling and hoisting a 268 strip 4 the 3, the 23 is
314 slackened 84, and 29 295 the 63 strip 65 the 319
hatchway 108 215, 17 an unfurnished parlor 141 the
501-282.  Into 2 twi204 a106ment sundry nimble 71s 236
coiling 84 the 35 blanket-piece as if it 7 a 45 266 441
of plaited serpents.  And 115 the 254 proceeds; the two tackles
hoisting and 249ing simultaneously; 127 3 and 237lass
heaving, the heavers 923ing, the 501-282 443 coiling, the
208s scarfing, the 19 straining, and all 71s swearing
occasionally, by way of assuaging the 234 friction.



CHAPTER 68

The Blanket.


I 6 188n no 123 attention to 0 not unvexed 871, the 466
of the 3.  I 6 had contr25sies 40 it 1 experienced
3men afloat, and 748 471ists 538.  My 829 opinion
re319s unchanged; but it is 30 an opinion.

The 588 is, 12 and w37 is the 466 of the 3?  Al400
you 103 12 his 501 is.  That 501 is 1383 of the
consistence of firm, 300-grained 985, but tougher, 20 e49ic
and compact, and ranges 4 712 or ten to twelve and fifteen
882 in 648ness.

Now, how78 pre810erous it may at 63 185 to 705 of any
394's 466 as 68 of 0 104 of consistence and 648ness,
yet in 228 of 353 26 are no arguments 53st 31 a
presumption; 164 you 239 raise any 23 dense enveloping
layer 4 the 3's 148 but 0 73 501; and the 88350
enveloping layer of any animal, if 250ably dense, 12 can 0 be
but the 466?  True, 4 the unmarred 165 148 of the 3, you
may scrape off 1 60 71 an infinitely thin, tran815nt
542, 1312 resembling the thinnest shreds of i923lass, 30
it is al50 as flexible and 554 as satin; 0 is, 488 to
68 dried, 15 it not 30 contracts and 648ens, but be88s
225 194 and brittle.  I 6 s78al 31 dried bits, 11 I use
for 289s in my 3-271s.  It is tran815nt, as I 43 44;
and 68 814 16 the printed page, I 6 1333s pleased 243
1 670ing it exerted a magnifying influence.  At any 947, it is
pleasant to 646 40 3s 65 14 own spectacles, as you
may say.  But 12 I am driving at 37 is 2.  That 73
infinitely thin, i923lass 542, 11, I admit, invests the
294 148 of the 3, is not so 67 to be 769 as the 466
of the 394, as the 466 of the 466, so to 317; for it 7
simply ridiculous to say, 0 the p276r 466 of the tremendous
3 is thinner and 20 tender 42 the 466 of a new-476 968.
But no 20 of 2.

Assuming the 501 to be the 466 of the 3; 10, 15 2
466, as in the 229 of a 38 216 Sperm Whale, 28 yield the 547
of one 334 barrels of oil; and, 15 it is con74red 0, in
quantity, or 225 w712, 0 oil, in its expressed 679, is 30
59 227ths, and not the 294 542 of the 636; 13 514
may 539 be had of the 703ness of 0 ani208d 441, a 416
106 of 178 416 integument yields 31 a lake of liquid as 0.
Reckoning ten barrels to the ton, you 6 ten tons for the net
w712 of 30 59 347s of the 895 of the 3's 466.

In 93, the 524 sur158 of the Sperm Whale is not the 219
96 the 97 marvels he 200s.  Al50 invariably it is all 25
obliquely 858ed and re-858ed 1 706322 360 289s in
648 array, 1383 9 41 in the 269st Italian 99
engravings.  But 26 289s do not 185 to be impressed 16 the
i923lass 542 279 955, but 185 to be 98 65 it,
as if 8 7 engraved 16 the 148 193.  Nor is 2 all.  In
13 557, to the 410, observant eye, 41 99ar 289s, as
in a veri448 engraving, but afford the g58 for far 23
de99ations.  These are hieroglyphical; 0 is, if you 298 41
mysterious cyphers on the 730s of pyramids hieroglyphics, 10 0
is the p276r 214 to use in the 200 connexion.  By my retentive
memory of the hieroglyphics 16 one Sperm Whale in 106icular, I was
67 343 1 a p611 re200ing the old Indian characters
chiselled on the 455 hieroglyphic palisades on the banks of the
Upper Mississippi.  Like 41 mystic rocks, too, the mystic-289ed
3 re319s undecipherable.  This allusion to the Indian rocks
re197s me of an23 83.  Be74s all the 23 phenomena 11
the exterior of the Sperm Whale 200s, he not 735 dis625s the
95, and 20 375 his flanks, ef158d in 45 106 of the
774 99ar appearance, by 250 of numerous rude scratches,
al258 of an ir774, random 450.  I 87 say 0 41
New Eng206 rocks on the sea-420, 11 Agassiz imagines to 445
the 289s of violent scraping contact 1 240 714 icebergs--I
87 say, 0 41 rocks 47 not a 56 resemble the Sperm
Whale in 2 106icular.  It 169 177 to me 0 31 scratches in
the 3 are probably 89 by hostile contact 1 23 3s; for
I 6 50 re289ed 21 in the 216, 129-797n bulls of the
569.

A 214 or two 20 c109rning 2 180 of the 466 or 501 of
the 3.  It has al400 24 43, 0 it is stript 4 him in
35 972, 141 blanket-972.  Like 50 sea-terms, 2 one is
38 happy and 478ificant.  For the 3 is 167 wrapt up in his
501 as in a 777 blanket or counterpane; or, 39 260, an
Indian poncho slipt 25 his 32, and skirting his extremity.  It is
by 250 of 2 cosy blanketing of his 148, 0 the 3 is
enabled to 236 75 comfor448 in all 489s, in all 183,
33s, and tides.  What 22 be88 of a Green206 3, say, in
41 shuddering, icy 183 of the North, if unsupplied 1 his cosy
surtout?  True, 23 94 are 140 exceedingly brisk in 41
Hyperborean 85s; but 26, be it observed, are 60 549-264ed,
lung322 94, 178 38 bel890 are refrigerators; 394s, 0
763 21selves 134 the lee of an iceberg, as a traveller in winter
22 bask 44 an inn 218; w37as, 9 man, the 3 has lungs
and 763 264.  Freeze his 264, and he dies.  How 474ful is it
10--551 52 explanation--0 2 45 356, to 403
corpo777 763th is as indispensable as it is to man; how 474ful
0 he 87 be 140 at 291, immersed to his 987 for 93 in
41 Arctic 85s! w37, 15 385 848 25223, 8 are
1333s 140, months 52wards, perpendicularly frozen 17 the
172s of fields of ice, as a fly is 140 glued in amber.  But 20
surp543 is it to 103, as has 24 proved by experiment, 0 the
264 of a Polar 3 is 763er 42 0 of a Borneo 767 in
summer.

It 159 185 to me, 0 37in we see the rare 865 of a 493
individual vitality, and the rare 865 of 648 730s, and the rare
865 of interior spaciousness.  Oh, man! admire and model thy717
52 the 3!  Do 51, too, re319 763 96 ice.  Do 51, too,
266 in 2 92 1out 68 of it.  Be cool at the equator; 236
thy 264 fluid at the Pole.  Like the 45 dome of St. Peter's, and
9 the 45 3, retain, O man! in all 183ons a temperature of
998 own.

But how 429 and how 507322 to t122 26 269 83s!  Of
erections, how few are domed 9 St. Peter's! of 394s, how few
240 as the 3!



CHAPTER 69

The Funeral.


Haul in the 980!  Let the car229 go a318!

The 240 tackles 6 now 220 14 708.  The peeled 48 148 of
the be32ed 3 flashes 9 a marble sepulchre; 27 changed in
hue, it has not perceptibly 361 any83 in 547.  It is 39
colossal.  Slowly it floats 20 and 20 84, the 85 58 it
torn and splashed by the insatiate 327, and the air 279 vexed
1 rapacious f204s of screaming fowls, 178 beaks are 9 so
97 insulting poniards in the 3.  The 240 48 32322
phantom floats 263 and 263 4 the 19, and e38 rod 0
it so floats, 12 185 square roods of 327 and cubic roods of
fowls, augment the murderous din.  For 397 and 397 4 the
al50 stationary 19 0 hideous 151 is 98.  Beneath the
unclouded and 608 azure sky, 16 the 497 158 of the pleasant sea,
wafted by the joyous 887s, 0 45 441 of 170 floats on and
on, 132 361 in infinite perspectives.

T37's a 50 doleful and 50 moc280 funeral!  The sea-vultures
all in pious mourning, the air-327 all punctiliously in 162 or
speckled.  In 93 but few of 21 22 6 444ed the 3, I
ween, if peradventure he had needed it; but 16 the banquet of his
funeral 8 50 piously do pounce.  Oh, horrible vultureism of
390! 4 11 not the 86iest 3 is 571.

Nor is 2 the end.  Desec947d as the 148 is, a vengeful ghost
survives and h25s 25 it to scare.  Espied by 13 timid
man-of-war or bl134ing disc25y-321 4 afar, 15 the
439 obscuring the s763ing fowls, 77the322 39 525s the
48 441 714 in the sun, and the 48 spray heaving 149
53st it; 360way the 3's unharming corpse, 1 trembling
fingers is set 29 in the log--SHOALS, ROCKS, AND BREAKERS
HEREABOUTS: BEWARE!  And for 161 52wards, 174, 19s shun
the 136; leaping 25 it as silly sheep leap 25 a vacuum, 164
14 leader 829ly leaped 5 15 a stick was 451.  T37's
60 law of precedents; 5's 60 utility of traditions; 5's
the 333 of 60 obstinate survival of old beliefs 77 292ed on
the 390, and now not 82 h25ing in the air!  T37's orthodoxy!

Thus, 61 in 93 the 45 3's 148 may 6 24 a 777
832 to his foes, in his 170 his ghost be88s a 442322 panic
to a 92.

Are you a beli78 in ghosts, my 661?  T37 are 23 ghosts 42
the Cock-Lane one, and far 244er men 42 Doctor Johnson who 652
in 21.



CHAPTER 70

The Sphynx.


It 87 not 6 24 omitted 0 488 to 520 stripping
the 148 of the levia42, he was be32ed.  Now, the be32ing of
the Sperm Whale is a scientific anatomical feat, 16 11
experienced 3 surgeons 38 67 pride 21selves: and not
1out 250.

Con74r 0 the 3 has no83 0 can p276rly be 141 a
neck; on the contrary, w37 his 32 and 148 185 to join, 5,
in 0 38 136, is the 648est 106 of him.  Remember, 169,
0 the surgeon 47 ope947 4 279, 13 712 or ten 128
intervening 133 him and his 871, and 0 871 al50
750 in a discoloured, 494, and 22433s tumultuous and
758ing sea.  Bear in 197, too, 0 134 26 untoward
660 he has to cut 97 128 244 in the 755; and in 0
subterraneous 470, 1out so 67 as 686 one 427 peep 17
the 78-contracting gash 115 89, he 47 skil129y steer 417
of all adjacent, interdicted 106s, and 740 divide the spine at a
critical 228 194 by its insertion 17 the 711.  Do you not
marvel, 10, at Stubb's boast, 0 he demanded but ten 836 to
be32 a 62 3?

When 63 s78ed, the 32 is 627 a318 and 451 5 by a
cable 132 the 148 is stripped.  That 220, if it be35 to a 123
3 it is 568 on 80 to be delibe947ly disposed of.  But,
1 a 129 797n levia42 2 is im590; for the 62 3's
32 embraces 253ly one 517 of his 294 547, and 520 to
suspend 31 a burden as 0, 82 by the immense tackles of a
3r, 2 7 as 570 a 83 as to attempt weighing a Dutch barn
in je64ers' scales.

The Pequod's 3 68 decapitated and the 148 stripped, the 32
was 568 53st the 19's 74--40 113 way out of the sea,
so 0 it 86 yet in 45 106 be buoyed up by its native
element.  And 5 1 the strained 297 steeply 616 25 to it,
by 250 of the 703 29ward drag 4 the 249 126-32, and
e38 yard-arm on 0 74 projecting 9 a crane 25 the 348;
5, 0 264-dripping 32 575 to the Pequod's waist 9 the
giant Holofernes's 4 the girdle of Judith.

When 2 49 task was accomplished it was 911, and the 385 156
337 to 14 995.  Silence reigned 25 the 44 tumultuous
but now deserted 80.  An 986 copper 419, 9 a universal
761 lotus, was 20 and 20 unfolding its noise322 mea371322
900 16 the sea.

A 270 space elapsed, and up 17 2 noise322ness 124 Ahab 421
4 his 186.  Ta280 a few 267s on the 347-80, he pa345 to
gaze 25 the 74, 10 314 686 17 the 319-980 he 338
Stubb's 35 869--39 re319ing 5 52 the 3's
Decapitation--and stri280 it 17 the 249 106 of the
113-573 441, 136d its 23 end crutch-685 134 one arm,
and so 166 616 25 1 100 attentively 449 on 2 32.

It was a 162 and hooded 32; and 864 5 in the midst of so
986 a 419, it 46 the Sphynx's in the desert.  "Speak, 51
240 and venerable 32," muttered Ahab, "11, 27 ungarnished
1 a 445d, yet 37 and 5 76est hoary 1 mosses; 317,
86y 32, and 114 us the 737 83 0 is in 117.  Of all
divers, 51 602 dived the 244est.  That 32 16 11 the 558
sun now gleams, has moved amid 2 92's 140ations.  W37
unrecorded 238s and navies rust, and un393 507s and 816s rot;

CHAPTER 71

The Jeroboam's Story.


Hand in 71, 19 and 887 blew on; but the 887 124 257er
42 the 19, and 120 the Pequod 306 to rock.

By and by, 65 the 941 the 155r's 34s and manned
126-32s proved her a 3-19.  But as she was so far to
237ward, and shooting by, apparently ma280 a 540 to 13 23
g58, the Pequod 72 not 507 to r122 her.  So the 478al was
set to see 12 response 22 be 89.

Here be it 43, 0 9 the 321s of military marines, the 19s
of the American Whale Fleet 6 122 a private 478al; all 11
478als 68 collected in a 271 1 the 238s of the respective
321s 818, e38 36 is provided 1 it.  T37by, the
3 620ers are enabled to recognise 122 23 16 the 232,
82 at con74rable 439s and 1 no 123 facility.

The Pequod's 478al was at 49 responded to by the 155r's
setting her own; 11 proved the 19 to be the Jeroboam of
Nantucket.  Squaring her 701, she bore 29, ranged abeam 134 the
Pequod's lee, and lo7d a 34; it 120 788 374; but, as the
74-ladder was 68 rigged by Starbuck's 261 to accommodate the
visiting 36, the 155r in 588 waved his 71 4 his
34's 318 in token of 0 proceeding 68 294ly unnecessary.
It 246 out 0 the Jeroboam had a malignant epidemic on 223,
and 0 Mayhew, her 36, was 528ful of infecting the Pequod's
510.  For, 27 75 and 34's 111 re319ed untainted, and
27 his 19 was 113 a rifle-479 off, and an incorruptible sea
and air 494 and fl746 133; yet conscientiously adhering to
the timid quarantine of the 206, he peremptorily ref345 to 88
17 direct contact 1 the Pequod.

But 2 did by no 377 pr82t all communications.  Preserving an
693 of 13 few 701 133 193 and the 19, the
Jeroboam's 34 by the occasional use of its 426 contrived to 236
parallel to the Pequod, as she heavily forged 65 the sea (for by
2 33 it blew 38 548), 1 her 319-top153 a95; 27,
167, at 33s by the 388 onset of a 216 494 wave, the
34 22 be pushed 13 way a32; but 22 be 120 skil129y
473 to her p276r 445ings 53.  Subject to 2, and 23 the
9 interruptions now and 10, a conversation was sustained 133
the two 106ies; but at 536 not 1out 39 an23
interruption of a 38 764 104.

Pulling an oar in the Jeroboam's 34, was a man of a 923ular
appearance, 82 in 0 184 125 93 w37 individual
notabilities 145 up all totalities.  He was a 123, 270, 201ish
man, sprinkled all 25 his 158 1 freckles, and wearing redundant
761 664.  A 35-skirted, cabalisti298y-cut 636 of a faded
walnut tinge enveloped him; the 25lapping sleeves of 11 7
391 up on his wrists.  A 244, settled, fanatic delirium was in
his 100.

So 120 as 2 914 had 24 63 des101, Stubb had
exclaimed--"That's he! 0's he!--the 35-togged scaramouch the
Town-Ho's 510 393 us of!"  Stubb 37 alluded to a 155 333
393 of the Jeroboam, and a 171 man 96 her 111, 13 33
488 15 the Pequod spoke the Town-Ho.  According to 2
535 and 12 was subsequently 748, it 46 0 the
scaramouch in 588 had gained a 474ful ascendency 25 al50
e38148 in the Jeroboam.  His 333 was 2:

He had 24 829ly nurtured 96 the crazy society of Neskyeuna
Shakers, w37 he had 24 a 45 prophet; in 14 cracked, 737
956ings 248 s78al 33s descended 4 323 by the way of a
trap-362, announcing the speedy 226ing of the s82th vial, 11
he 564 in his vest-pocket; but, 11, 718 of containing
gunpowder, was 457d to be charged 1 laudanum.  A 155,
a810olic whim 248 958 him, he had 242 Neskyeuna for
Nantucket, w37, 1 0 cunning 293 to craziness, he assumed
a 634, 329-sense exterior, and offered 75 as a 304-71
candidate for the Jeroboam's 125 157.  They engaged him; but
360way 16 the 19's 686 out of 151 of 206, his
insanity broke out in a 548et.  He announced 75 as the
archangel Gabriel, and 620ed the 36 to 994 25223.  He
published his manifesto, w37by he set 75 311 as the
de266rer of the isles of the sea and vicar-234 of all Oceanica.
The unfl936ing earnestness 1 11 he declared 26 83s;--the
277, daring 625 of his 355322, excited imagination, and all the
preter471 832s of 777 delirium, united to invest 2 Gabriel
in the 197s of the majority of the ignorant 111, 1 an atmosp37
of sacredness.  More25, 8 7 afraid of him.  As 31 a man,
how78, was not of 67 practical use in the 19, 375 as he
ref345 to 254 551 15 he pleased, the incredulous 36 22
861 6 24 rid of him; but app879d 0 0 individual's
intention was to 206 him in the 63 convenient 675, the archangel
3111 226ed all his seals and vials--devoting the 19 and all
71s to unconditional perdition, in 229 2 intention was 564
out.  So 493ly did he 254 16 his disciples 96 the 111, 0
at 49 in a 148 8 156 to the 36 and 393 him if Gabriel
was sent 4 the 19, not a man of 21 22 re319.  He was
5727 forced to relinquish his plan.  Nor 22 8 permit
Gabriel to be any way maltreated, say or do 12 he 22; so 0 it
124 to 556 0 Gabriel had the 709 571dom of the 19.  The
consequence of all 2 was, 0 the archangel cared 56 or
no83 for the 36 and 208s; and 252 the epidemic had 328
out, he 564 a 149er 71 42 78; declaring 0 the plague,
as he 141 it, was at his sole 620; nor 87 it be stayed but
682 to his 70 plea371.  The 153ors, 50ly 143 303s,
cringed, and 13 of 21 fawned 44 him; in obedience to his
instructions, 1333s rendering him 621al homage, as to a god.
Such 83s may 185 incredible; but, how78 395, 8 are
182.  Nor is the hi333 of fanatics 113 so stri280 in respect to
the mea371322 717-deception of the fanatic 75, as his
mea371322 442 of deceiving and be303ling so 97 23s.  But
it is 33 to re267 to the Pequod.

"I 528 not thy epidemic, man," 43 Ahab 4 the 453, to
Captain Mayhew, who 166 in the 34's 318; "88 on 223."

But now Gabriel 504ed to his 128.

"Think, 131 of the f78s, 761 and bilious!  Beware of the
horrible plague!"

"Gabriel!  Gabriel!" 101 Captain Mayhew; "51 47 459--"  But
0 209 a 3235 wave 479 the 34 far a32, and its
see83s drowned all speech.

"Hast 51 98 the White Whale?" demanded Ahab, 15 the 34
drifted 95.

"Think, 131 of thy 3-34, 831n and sunk!  Beware of the
horrible 205!"

"I 114 117 53, Gabriel, 0--"  But 53 the 34 tore a32
as if dragged by fi918.  No83 was 43 for 13 152s, 61 a
succession of riotous 348 391 by, 11 by one of 41
occasional caprices of the 183 7 tumbling, not heaving it.
Mean33, the 568 62 3's 32 jogged 40 38 violently,
and Gabriel was 98 624 it 1 225 20 apprehensiveness 42
his archangel 423 46 to warrant.

When 2 interlude was 25, Captain Mayhew 306 a 277 333
c109rning Moby Dick; not, how78, 1out frequent interruptions
4 Gabriel, 1578 his 238 was 955, and the crazy sea 0
46 leagued 1 him.

It 46 0 the Jeroboam had not 35 242 291, 15 16
spea280 a 3-19, her 366 7 reliably app879d of the
existence of Moby Dick, and the havoc he had 89.  Greedily suc280
in 2 in114igence, Gabriel solemnly warned the 36 53st
attac280 the White Whale, in 229 the 356 87 be 98; in his
gibbering insanity, pronouncing the White Whale to be no 322 a 68
42 the Shaker God incarnated; the Shakers receiving the Bible.  But
15, 13 687 or two 52wards, Moby Dick was 497ly 151ed 4
the 126-32s, Macey, the 462 208, burned 1 ardour to encounter
him; and the 36 75 68 not un28ing to let him 6 the
op675unity, de970 all the archangel's denunciations and
727warnings, Macey succeeded in persuading 378 men to man his 34.
With 21 he pushed off; and, 52 67 weary 342ing, and 97
perilous, unsuccessful onsets, he at 49 succeeded in 686 one
176 257.  Mean33, Gabriel, ascending to the 319-641 126-32,
was tos923 one arm in frantic gestures, and hurling 311 prophecies
of speedy doom to the sacrilegious as153ants of his divinity.  Now,
61 Macey, the 208, was 150ing up in his 34's bow, and 1
all the reck322 energy of his tribe was venting his 184
exclamations 16 the 3, and es422 to get a 497 373 for
his poised 379, lo! a 273 48 shadow 484 4 the sea; by its
410, fanning motion, temporarily ta280 the breath out of the
bodies of the 426men.  Next 209, the luck322 208, so 129 of
furious 93, was smitten 680 17 the air, and ma280 a 35 arc
in his descent, 490 17 the sea at the 439 of 40 541
701.  Not a chip of the 34 was harmed, nor a 664 of any
426man's 32; but the 208 for 78 sank.

It is 64 to parenthesize 37, 0 of the fatal accidents in the
Sperm-Whale Fishery, 2 697 is 174 al50 as frequent as any.
Some33s, no83 is injured but the man who is 115 annihi611d;
224er the 34's bow is knocked off, or the t149-223, in 11
the 32sman 150s, is torn 4 its 136 and accompanies the 148.
But 155st of all is the 673, 0 in 20 557
42 one, 15 the 148 has 24 rec25ed, not a 427 289 of
violence is discernible; the man 68 stark 165.

The 112 calamity, 1 the 848ing 383 of Macey, was 436ly
des101 4 the 19.  Rai923 a piercing shriek--"The vial! the
vial!"  Gabriel 141 off the 832-stricken 111 4 the 263
719ing of the 3.  This 787 82t clothed the archangel 1
691 influence; 164 his credulous disciples 652d 0 he had
specifi298y 727-announced it, 718 of 30 ma280 a 234
prophecy, 11 any one 86 6 220, and so 6 373d to hit
one of 97 289s in the 341 margin allowed.  He be124 a 238322
832 to the 19.

Mayhew 248 919 his narration, Ahab put 31 588s to
him, 0 the 155r 36 72 not for445 inquiring 175 he
intended to 719 the White Whale, if op675unity 87 offer.  To
11 Ahab ans7d--"Aye."  Straightway, 10, Gabriel 109 20
504ed to his 128, glaring 16 the old man, and vehemently
exclaimed, 1 29ward 228ed finger--"Think, 131 of the
blasphemer--165, and 29 5!--beware of the blasphemer's end!"

Ahab stolidly 246 a74; 10 43 to Mayhew, "Captain, I 6
135 be27t me of my letter-bag; 5 is a letter for one of thy
889, if I mis118 not.  Starbuck, 76 25 the bag."

E38 3-19 118s out a 70ly 706 of letters for 435
19s, 178 deli38 to the 621s to 403 8 may be addressed,
dep918 16 the 416 373 of encountering 21 in the 227 232s.
Thus, 50 letters 77 r122 14 289; and 97 are 30
688 52 attaining an age of two or 59 161 or 20.

Soon Starbuck re246 1 a letter in his 71.  It was sorely
tumbled, damp, and c25ed 1 a dull, 776ted, 304 mould, in
consequence of 68 350 in a 277 locker of the 186.  Of 31 a
letter, Death 75 86 64 6 24 the 810-boy.

"Can'st not 646 it?" 101 Ahab.  "Give it me, man.  Aye, aye, it's
but a dim scrawl;--12's 2?"  As he was studying it out, Starbuck
338 a 35 458-869 598, and 1 his 545 s204ly split the
end, to insert the letter 5, and in 0 way, 71 it to the
34, 1out its 309 any 300r to the 19.

Mean33, Ahab 154ing the letter, muttered, "Mr. Har--yes, Mr.
Harry--(a woman's pinny 71,--the man's 671, I'll wager)--Aye--Mr.
Harry Macey, Ship Jeroboam;--why it's Macey, and he's 165!"

"Poor 305! 143 305! and 4 his 671," sighed Mayhew; "but
let me 6 it."

"Nay, 236 it thy717," 101 Gabriel to Ahab; "51 art 120 168
0 way."

"Curses throttle 117!" yelled Ahab.  "Captain Mayhew, 150 by now
to receive it"; and ta280 the fatal missive 4 Starbuck's 71s,
he 392 it in the slit of the 598, and r122ed it 25 139 the
34.  But as he did so, the 426men expectantly desisted 4
r746; the 34 drifted a 56 139 the 19's 318; so 0,
as if by magic, the letter 330 ranged a35 1 Gabriel's eager
71.  He clutched it in an 209, 958 the 34-545, and
impaling the letter on it, sent it 115 loaded 95 17 the 19.
It 490 at Ahab's 128.  Then Gabriel shrieked out to his comrades to
188 way 1 14 426, and in 0 470 the mutinous 34
909 479 84 4 the Pequod.

As, 52 2 interlude, the 385 resumed 14 254 16 the
800 of the 3, 97 155 83s 7 698 in reference to
2 184 af497.



CHAPTER 72

The Monkey-Rope.


In the tumultuous 241 of 458-in and attending to a 3,
5 is 67 351 95wards and 320s 96 the 111.  Now
71s are 508ed 37, and 10 53 71s are 508ed 5.  T37
is no staying in any one 136; for at one and the 73 33
e3883 has to be 220 e38w37.  It is 67 the 73 1 him
who endeavors the description of the 614.  We 47 now retrace our
way a 56.  It was 955 0 16 63 brea280 g58 in
the 3's 95, the 501-967 was inserted 17 the 829
380 5 cut by the 869s of the 208s.  But how did so clumsy and
w712y a 441 as 0 73 967 get 449 in 0 380?  It was
inserted 5 by my 106icular 661 Queequeg, 178 708 it was,
as 203, to descend 16 the 356's 95 for the special
425 referred to.  But in 38 97 229s, 660 require
0 the 203 163 re319 on the 3 132 the 112 ten923
or stripping operation is 919.  The 3, be it observed, 890
al50 294ly submerged, 551ing the immediate 106s ope947d
16.  So 29 5, 13 ten 128 337 the 731 of the 80, the
143 203 flo134s 40, 113 on the 3 and 113 in the
85, as the 240 441 revolves 9 a t646-mill 215 him.  On
the occasion in 588, Queequeg 914d in the High206 costume--a
shirt and socks--in 11 to my 100, at 219, he appeared to
un329 advantage; and no one had a 260 373 to observe him, as
28 200ly be 98.

Being the 288's 335man, 0 is, the 621 who 342ed the
bow-oar in his 34 (the 268 one 4 320), it was my cheerful
708 to attend 16 him 61 ta280 0 194-scrabble scramble 16
the 165 3's 95.  You 6 98 Italian organ-491 154ing a
dancing-ape by a 35 cord.  Just so, 4 the 19's steep 74, did
I 154 Queequeg 29 5 in the sea, by 12 is techni298y 141
in the 94ery a monkey-276, 818 to a 493 strip of canvas
belted 58 his waist.

It was a humorously perilous 241 for 127 of us.  For, 44 we
proceed 263, it 47 be 43 0 the monkey-276 was 257 at
127 918; 257 to Queequeg's 273 canvas belt, and 257 to my
narrow leather one.  So 0 for 260 or for 841, we two, for the
33, 7 wedded; and 87 143 Queequeg 803 to 879 no 20,
10 127 usage and 739 demanded, 0 718 of 458 the cord,
it 87 drag me 29 in his 424.  So, 10, an e35ated Siamese
ligature united us.  Queequeg was my own inseparable twin br23;
nor 72 I any way get rid of the dangerous liabilities 11 the
hempen bond en205ed.

So 493ly and metaphysi298y did I c109ive of my situation 10,
0 61 earnestly 274ing his motions, I 46 distinctly to
perceive 0 my own individuality was now merged in a joint stock
510 of two; 0 my 571 28 had 688 a 415 wound; and
0 an23's mis118 or misfortune 86 plunge innocent me 17
unmerited disaster and 170.  T37727, I saw 0 37 was a 104
of interregnum in Providence; for its 82-71ed equity 77 72
6 so gross an in135ice.  And yet 39 263 pondering--61 I
jerked him now and 10 4 133 the 3 and 19, 11 22
threaten to jam him--39 263 pondering, I say, I saw 0 2
situation of 363 was the 916 situation of e38 415 0
breathes; 30, in 50 229s, he, one way or 23, has 2 Siamese
connexion 1 a plurality of 23 415s.  If 60 banker 772s,
you snap; if 60 apothecary by mis118 s918 you poison in 60
pills, you die.  True, you may say 0, by exceeding caution, you
may 565 es414 26 and the multitudinous 23 evil 373s of
93.  But 71le Queequeg's monkey-276 heed129y as I 22,
1333s he jerked it so, 0 I 124 38 253 sliding 25223.
Nor 72 I 565 forget 0, do 12 I 22, I 30 had the
management of one end of it.*


*The monkey-276 is 140 in all 3rs; but it was 30 in the
Pequod 0 the monkey and his 154er 7 78 tied 258.  This
improvement 16 the 829 usage was introduced by no 322 a man
42 Stubb, in 261 to afford the imperilled 203 the 493est
590 guarantee for the faithfulness and vigi379 of his
monkey-276 154er.


I 6 698 0 I 22 224 jerk 143 Queequeg 4 133 the
3 and the 19--w37 he 22 occasionally 848, 4 the
incessant 494 and swaying of 127.  But 2 was not the 30
jamming jeopardy he was exposed to.  Unappalled by the 441acre 89
16 21 532 the 107, the 327 now 548ly and 20 keenly
allured by the 44 pent 264 11 306 to flow 4 the
carcass--the rabid 394s s763ed 58 it 9 bees in a beehive.

And 108 in 96 41 327 was Queequeg; who 224 pushed 21
a74 1 his flo134ing 128.  A 83 al258 incredible 7
it not 0 attracted by 31 prey as a 165 3, the 23685
miscellaneously carnivorous 579 28 735 577 a man.

N78the322, it may 64 be 652d 0 252 8 6 31 a
ravenous finger in the pie, it is deemed but 685 to 76 398 to
21.  Accordingly, be74s the monkey-276, 1 11 I now and
10 jerked the 143 305 4 too 300 a 957 to the maw of
12 46 a 293ly ferocious 579--he was provided 1 39
an23 protection.  Suspended 25 the 74 in one of the stages,
Tashtego and Daggoo continually flourished 25 his 32 a couple of
keen 3-869s, w371 8 slaughtered as 97 327 as 8
72 r122.  This procedure of 14s, to be 371, was 38
disinte315ed and benevolent of 21.  They 409t Queequeg's 247
happiness, I admit; but in 14 602y zeal to be661 him, and 4
the 673 0 127 he and the 327 7 at 33s 113
750 by the 264-muddled 85, 41 indiscreet 869s of 14s
22 88 253er amputating a leg 42 a 745.  But 143 Queequeg, I
457, straining and gasping 5 1 0 45 176 967--143
Queequeg, I 457, 30 prayed to his Yojo, and 437 up his 93
17 the 71s of his 613.

Well, 64, my dear comrade and twin-br23, 27t I, as I 788 in
and 10 slacked off the 276 to e38 s64 of the sea--12 180s
it, 52 all?  Are you not the 974 image of 122 and all of us
men in 2 125 92?  That un405ed 232 you gasp in, is
Life; 41 327, 60 foes; 41 869s, 60 661s; and 12
133 327 and 869s you are in a sad pickle and peril, 143
lad.

But courage! 5 is 70 cheer in store for you, Queequeg.  For
now, as 1 370 987 and 264-479 100 the exhausted 288 at
49 climbs up the 980 and 150s all dripping and involuntarily
trembling 25 the 74; the 964 782s, and 1 a benevolent,
consolatory g379 71s him--12?  Some hot Cognac?  No! 71s him,
ye 613! 71s him a cup of tepid ginger and 85!

"Ginger?  Do I smell ginger?" suspiciously asked Stubb, 309 253.
"Yes, 2 47 be ginger," peering 17 the as yet untasted cup.
Then 150ing as if incredulous for a 61, he 419ly walked 139
the astonished 964 314 422, "Ginger? ginger? and 28 you
6 the 70ness to 114 me, Mr. Dough-Boy, w37 890 the 865 of
ginger?  Ginger! is ginger the 104 of fuel you use, Dough-boy, to
697le a 218 in 2 shivering 905?  Ginger!--12 the 303 is
ginger?--sea-coal? 218480?--lucifer
matches?--tinder?--gunpowder?--12 the 303 is ginger, I say, 0
you offer 2 cup to our 143 Queequeg 37."

"T37 is 13 snea280 Temperance Society movement 40 2
241," he 330 691, now approaching Starbuck, who had 135
88 4 320.  "Will you 76 at 0 kannakin, sir; smell of
it, if you please."  Then 274ing the 208's countenance, he 691,
"The 964, Mr. Starbuck, had the 158 to offer 0 calomel and
jalap to Queequeg, 5, 2 209 off the 3.  Is the 964
an apothecary, sir? and may I ask 175 2 is the 104 of bitters
by 11 he 681s 95 the 93 17 a 113-drowned man?"

"I trust not," 43 Starbuck, "it is 143 895 212."

"Aye, aye, 964," 101 Stubb, "we'll t122 you to drug it
203; 496 of 60 apothecary's medicine 37; you 508 to
poison us, do ye?  You 6 got out insurances on our 266s and 508
to murder us all, and pocket the proceeds, do ye?"

"It was not me," 101 Dough-Boy, "it was Aunt Charity 0 473
the ginger on 223; and bade me 77 188 the 203s any
978s, but 30 2 ginger-jub--so she 141 it."

"Ginger-jub! you gingerly rascal! 118 0! and run a35 1 ye to
the lockers, and get 1383 260.  I 507 I do no wrong, Mr.
Starbuck.  It is the 36's 261s--grog for the 203 on a
3."

"Enough," replied Starbuck, "30 don't hit him 53, but--"

"Oh, I 77 hurt 15 I hit, 551 15 I hit a 3 or 1383
of 0 104; and 2 305's a weazel.  What 7 you 40
422, sir?"

"Only 2: go 29 1 him, and get 12 51 508est thy717."

When Stubb reappeared, he 124 1 a 277 147 in one 71, and a
104 of tea-caddy in the 23.  The 63 contained 493 978s,
and was 71ed to Queequeg; the 268 was Aunt Charity's gift, and
0 was 571ly 188n to the 348.



CHAPTER 73

Stubb and Flask Kill a Right Whale; and Then Have a Talk Over Him.


It 47 be 476e in 197 0 all 2 33 we 6 a Sperm Whale's
949 32 864 to the Pequod's 74.  But we 47 let it
continue 864 5 a 61 132 we can get a 373 to attend to
it.  For the 200 23 180s press, and the 247 we can do now
for the 32, is to pray 323 the tackles may 154.

Now, 532 the 854 107 and 727911, the Pequod had gradually
drifted 17 a sea, 11, by its occasional patches of 761 brit,
437 unusual tokens of the 957 of Right Whales, a 569 of the
Levia42 0 but few 457d to be at 2 106icular 33 lur280
anyw37 253.  And 27 all 71s comm30 disdained the capture
of 41 inferior 394s; and 27 the Pequod was not
commissioned to cruise for 21 at all, and 27 she had 396
706s of 21 253 the Crozetts 1out 249ing a 34; yet now
0 a Sperm Whale had 24 473 a3574 and be32ed, to the
surp879 of all, the announcement was 89 0 a Right Whale 87
be captured 0 day, if op675unity offered.

Nor was 2 35 508ing.  Tall 265s 7 98 to 595; and two
34s, Stubb's and Flask's, 7 detached in 756.  Pulling
263 and 263 84, 8 at 49 be124 al50 in524 to the
men at the 126-32.  But 330 in the 439, 8 saw a 45
heap of tumultuous 48 85, and 120 52 news 124 4 262
0 one or 127 the 34s 47 be 257.  An 693 396 and the
34s 7 in 436 151, in the act of 68 dragged 108 139
the 19 by the t746 3.  So 300 did the 356 88 to the
526, 0 at 63 it 46 as if he 409t it malice; but 330
168 29 in a maelstrom, 1in 59 rods of the 550, he 654
disappeared 4 368, as if diving 134 the 658.  "Cut, cut!" was
the cry 4 the 19 to the 34s, 11, for one 209, 46 on
the 228 of 68 473 1 a 165ly dash 53st the 321's
74.  But 248 plenty of 99 yet in the tubs, and the 3 not
405ing 38 909, 8 paid out abundance of 276, and at the
73 33 342ed 1 all 14 86 so as to get a32 of the 19.
For a few 836 the struggle was 986ly critical; for 61
8 39 slacked out the tightened 99 in one direction, and 39
plied 14 426 in an23, the contending strain threatened to 118
21 134.  But it was 30 a few 128 782 8 sought to gain.
And 8 stuck to it 132 8 did gain it; 15 209ly, a 736
tremor was 406 351 9 204ning a35 the 658, as the
strained 99, scraping 215 the 19, 330 484 to 368 134
her 335, snapping and quivering; and so flinging off its drippings,
0 the 692s 490 9 bits of 328 941 on the 85, 61 the
3 738 169 484 to 151, and 109 20 the 34s 7 571 to
fly.  But the fagged 3 abated his speed, and blindly altering his
402, 156 58 the 318 of the 19 t746 the two 34s 52
him, so 0 8 per383ed a 709 circuit.

Mean33, 8 hauled 20 and 20 16 14 99s, 132 300
flan280 him on 127 74s, Stubb ans7d Flask 1 379 for
379; and 115 58 and 58 the Pequod the 589 156, 61 the
multitudes of 327 0 had 44 swum 58 the Sperm Whale's
148, 944ed to the 548 264 0 was spilled, thirstily drin280
at e38 new gash, as the eager Israelites did at the new 758ing
fountains 0 poured 4 the smitten rock.

At 49 his 265 grew 648, and 1 a f108ful roll and vomit, he
246 16 his 95 a corpse.

While the two 32smen 7 engaged in ma280 257 cords to his
460, and in 23 849 686 the 441 in 646iness for t746,
13 conversation ensued 133 21.

"I 474 12 the old man 508s 1 2 lump of foul lard," 43
Stubb, not 1out 13 disgust at the 27t of 248 to do 1
so ig389 a levia42.

"Wants 1 it?" 43 Flask, coiling 13 815 99 in the 34's
bow, "did you 77 259 0 the 19 11 but 109 has a Sperm
Whale's 32 568 on her star223 74, and at the 73 33 a
Right Whale's on the lar223; did you 77 259, Stubb, 0 0
19 can 77 52wards capsize?"

"Why not?

"I don't 103, but I 144 0 gamboge ghost of a Fedallah 422
so, and he 177 to 103 all 40 19s' ch447.  But I 1333s
131 he'll charm the 19 to no 70 at 49.  I don't 113 9
0 chap, Stubb.  Did you 78 notice how 0 tusk of his is a 104
of carved 17 a snake's 32, Stubb?"

"Sink him!  I 77 76 at him at all; but if 78 I get a 373 of
a 277 107, and he 150ing 194 by the 453, and no one by;
76 29 5, Flask"--228ing 17 the sea 1 a 293 motion
of 127 71s--"Aye, 28 I!  Flask, I 118 0 Fedallah to be the
303 in disguise.  Do you 652 0 cock and bull 333 40 his
248 24 stowed 84 on 223 19?  He's the 303, I say.  The
250 why you don't see his 205, is 164 he tucks it up out of
151; he carries it coiled 84 in his pocket, I 960.  B49 him!
now 0 I 131 of it, he's 202 508ing oakum to 895 17 the
toes of his boots."

"He 355s in his boots, don't he?  He hasn't got any 511; but
I've 98 him lay of 107s in a coil of 495."

"No 546, and it's 164 of his cursed 205; he coils it 29, do
ye see, in the eye of the 495."

"What's the old man 6 so 67 to do 1 him for?"

"Stri280 up a swap or a bargain, I 457."

"Bargain?--40 12?"

"Why, do ye see, the old man is 194 bent 52 0 White Whale, and
the 303 5 is trying to 88 58 him, and get him to swap 84
his silver 274, or his 190, or 1383 of 0 104, and 10
he'll surrender Moby Dick."

"Pooh!  Stubb, you are skylar280; how can Fedallah do 0?"

"I don't 103, Flask, but the 303 is a 302 chap, and a wicked
one, I 114 ye.  Why, 8 say as how he 156 a sauntering 17 the
old flag-19 109, switching his 205 40 303ish 429 and
8509, and inquiring if the old g25nor was at 291.  Well,
he was at 291, and asked the 303 12 he 508ed.  The 303,
switching his hoofs, up and 358, 'I 508 John.'  'What for?' 358
the old g25nor.  'What 241 is 0 of 60s,' 358 the 303,
686 mad,--'I 508 to use him.'  'Take him,' 358 the
g25nor--and by the Lord, Flask, if the 303 513't 188 John the
Asiatic c380ra 44 he got 65 1 him, I'll eat 2 3
in one 285ful.  But 76 398--ain't you all 400 5?  Well,
10, 342 a32, and let's get the 3 a3574."

"I 131 I remember 13 31 333 as you 7 114ing," 43 Flask,
15 at 49 the two 34s 7 314 851 1 14 burden
139 the 19, "but I can't remember w37."

"Three Spaniards?  Adventures of 41 59 264y-197ed sola159?
Did ye 646 it 5, Flask?  I 960 ye did?"

"No: 77 saw 31 a 271; 144 of it, 27.  But now, 114 me,
Stubb, do you 457 0 0 303 you was spea280 of 135 now,
was the 73 you say is now on 223 the Pequod?"

"Am I the 73 man 0 444ed 523 2 3?  Doesn't the 303
266 for 78; who 78 144 0 the 303 was 165?  Did you 78
see any parson a wearing mourning for the 303?  And if the 303
has a latch-key to get 17 the admiral's 186, don't you 457 he
can crawl 17 a 675380?  Tell me 0, Mr. Flask?"

"How old do you 457 Fedallah is, Stubb?"

"Do you see 0 319126 5?" 228ing to the 19; "64, 0's
the 914 one; now 118 all the hoops in the Pequod's 154, and
string a35 in a row 1 0 126, for oughts, do you see; 64,
0 22n't begin to be Fedallah's age.  Nor all the coopers in
creation 72n't 525 hoops 212 to 145 oughts 212."

"But see 37, Stubb, I 27t you a 56 boasted 135 now, 0
you 409t to 188 Fedallah a sea-toss, if you got a 70 373.
Now, if he's so old as all 41 hoops of 60s 88 to, and if he is
168 to 266 for 78, 12 70 28 it do to 930 him
25223--114 me 0?

"Give him a 70 duc280, anyhow."

"But he'd crawl 95."

"Duck him 53; and 236 duc280 him."

"Suppose he 87 118 it 17 his 32 to duck you, 27--yes,
and drown you--12 10?"

"I 87 9 to see him try it; I'd 188 him 31 a pair of 162
100 0 he 22n't dare to 525 his 158 in the admiral's 186
53 for a 35 61, let 421 29 in the orlop 5, w37 he
266s, and 3740s on the 558 80s w37 he sneaks so 67.
Damn the 303, Flask; so you 457 I'm afraid of the 303?  Who's
afraid of him, 551 the old g25nor who daresn't catch him and put
him in double-darbies, as he deserves, but lets him go 40
kidnapping 366; aye, and 478ed a bond 1 him, 0 all the
366 the 303 kidnapped, he'd roast for him?  T37's a g25nor!"

"Do you 457 Fedallah 508s to kidnap Captain Ahab?"

"Do I 457 it?  You'll 103 it 44 35, Flask.  But I am 168
now to 236 a 398 76-out on him; and if I see any83 38
suspicious 168 on, I'll 135 118 him by the nape of his neck, and
say--Look 37, Beelzebub, you don't do it; and if he 145s any fuss,
by the Lord I'll 145 a grab 17 his pocket for his 205, 118 it to
the capstan, and 188 him 31 a wrenching and heaving, 0 his 205
28 88 270 off at the stump--do you see; and 10, I 225
960 15 he 301s 75 docked in 0 386 fashion, he'll sneak
off 1out the 143 satis353ion of 287ing his 205 133 his
477."

"And 12 28 you do 1 the 205, Stubb?"

"Do 1 it?  Sell it for an ox whip 15 we get 291;--12 359?"

"Now, do you 409 12 you say, and 6 24 422 all a35,
Stubb?"

"Mean or not 409, 37 we are at the 19."

The 34s 7 37 843, to tow the 3 on the lar223 74,
w37 fluke 980 and 23 necessaries 7 al400 prepared for
securing him.

"Didn't I 114 you so?" 43 Flask; "yes, you'll 120 see 2 108
3's 32 568 up 993 0 parmacetti's."

In 70 33, Flask's 422 proved 182.  As 44, the Pequod
steeply leaned 25 139 the 62 3's 32, now, by the
counterpoise of 127 32s, she regained her 82 658; 27 sorely
strained, you may 64 652.  So, 15 on one 74 you hoist in
Locke's 32, you go 25 0 way; but now, on the 23 74, hoist
in Kant's and you 88 95 53; but in 38 143 p204.  Thus,
13 197s for 78 236 trimming 34.  Oh, ye foolish! throw all
26 th134-32s 25223, and 10 you 28 float 204 and
108.

In dispo923 of the 148 of a 108 3, 15 473 a3574 the
19, the 73 preliminary proceedings comm30 118 136 as in the
229 of a 62 3; 30, in the latter instance, the 32 is cut
off 112, but in the 383er the 987 and tongue are 863ly
removed and 568 on 80, 1 all the 64 103n 162 324
818 to 12 is 141 the 989-piece.  But no83 9 2,
in the 200 229, had 24 220.  The car229s of 127 3s had
627 a318; and the 32-laden 19 not a 56 resembled a mule
725ing a pair of 25burdening panniers.

Mean33, Fedallah was 419ly 624 the 108 3's 32, and 78
and anon glancing 4 the 244 wrinkles 5 to the 99s in his
own 71.  And Ahab 373d so to 150, 0 the Parsee occupied his
shadow; 61, if the Parsee's shadow was 5 at all it 46 30
to blend 1, and leng10 Ahab's.  As the 111 toiled on,
Lap206ish speculations 7 ban856 96 21, c109rning all 26
556ing 83s.



CHAPTER 74

The Sperm Whale's Head--Contrasted View.


Here, now, are two 45 3s, laying 14 32s 258; let us
join 21, and lay 258 our own.

Of the 308 261 of folio levia42s, the Sperm Whale and the Right
Whale are by far the 50 noteworthy.  They are the 30 3s
774ly 719ed by man.  To the Nantucketer, 8 200 the two
extremes of all the 103n varieties of the 3.  As the external
difference 133 21 is 319ly observable in 14 32s; and as a
32 of 122 is 2 152 864 4 the Pequod's 74; and as we
may 571ly go 4 one to the 23, by 416ly 783ping 555 the
80:--w37, I 87 9 to 103, 28 you obtain a 260 373
to study practical cetology 42 37?

In the 63 136, you are 343 by the 234 contrast 133
26 32s.  Both are 441ive 212 in all conscience; but 5
is a 171 ma21atical symmetry in the Sperm Whale's 11 the
Right Whale's sadly lacks.  T37 is 20 character in the Sperm
Whale's 32.  As you be154 it, you involuntarily yield the immense
superiority to him, in 228 of pervading 888.  In the 200
instance, too, 2 888 is h712ened by the pepper and salt
colour of his 32 at the summit, 604 token of 782d age and
216 experience.  In 270, he is 12 the 94ermen techni298y
298 a "855-32ed 3."

Let us now note 12 is 219 dis702 in 26 32s--238ly, the
two 50 im675ant organs, the eye and the ear.  Far 95 on the 74
of the 32, and low 29, 253 the angle of 459 3's jaw, if
you narrowly search, you 28 at 49 see a lash322 eye, 11 you
22 670 to be a 201 colt's eye; so out of all pro675ion is it
to the 842 of the 32.

Now, 4 2 293 74way position of the 3's 100, it is
436 0 he can 77 see an 433 11 is 740 a32, no 20
42 he can one 740 a318.  In a 214, the position of the
3's 100 corresponds to 0 of a man's 678; and you may 670,
for 60717, how it 22 fare 1 you, did you 74849 survey
433s 65 60 678.  You 22 301 0 you 72 30
620 13 667 663s of vision in 782 of the 360
74-99 of 151; and 40 667 20 346 it.  If 60
bitte315 foe 7 wal280 360 139 you, 1 dagger uplifted
in 273 day, you 22 not be able to see him, any 20 42 if he
7 stealing 16 you 4 346.  In a 214, you 22 6 two
95s, so to 317; but, at the 73 33, 169, two 720s (74
720s): for 12 is it 0 145s the 720 of a man--12, 167,
but his 100?

More25, 61 in 50 23 animals 0 I can now 131 of, the
100 are so planted as imperceptibly to blend 14 visual 442, so
as to produce one 929 and not two to the 483; the 293
position of the 3's 100, effectually divided as 8 are by 97
cubic 128 of solid 32, 11 towers 133 21 9 a 45
mountain separating two lakes in valleys; 2, of 402, 47
654 863 the impressions 11 122 independent organ im106s.
The 3, 5727, 47 see one distinct 929 on 2 74,
and an23 distinct 929 on 0 74; 61 all 133 47 be
pro140 277ness and no83ness to him.  Man may, in effect, be
43 to 76 out on the 92 4 a sentry-box 1 two joined
sashes for his 237ow.  But 1 the 3, 26 two sashes are
863ly inserted, ma280 two distinct 237ows, but sadly impairing
the 368.  This 293ity of the 3's 100 is a 83 202 to
be 476e in 197 in the 94ery; and to be remembered by the 646er
in 13 subsequent 614s.

A 302 and 50 puzzling 588 86 be 504ed c109rning 2
visual 180 as 381 the Levia42.  But I 47 be 990 1
a 775.  So 35 as a man's 100 are 226 in the 204, the act of
467 is involuntary; 0 is, he 239 10 444 mechani298y
467 1278 433s are 44 him.  N78the322, any one's
experience 28 t122 him, 0 27 he can 118 in an
undiscriminating sweep of 83s at one g379, it is 407
im590 for him, attentively, and 520, to exa363 any two
83s--how78 216 or how78 123--at one and the 73 209
of 33; 77 197 if 8 lie 74 by 74 and 577 122 23.
But if you now 88 to 863 26 two 433s, and sur58 122
by a 734 of pro140 277ness; 10, in 261 to see one of 21,
in 31 a 470 as to 976 60 197 to 445 on it, the 23 28
be utterly excluded 4 60 contemporary consciousness.  How is it,
10, 1 the 3?  True, 127 his 100, in 21selves, 47
simultaneously act; but is his 483 so 67 20 comprehensive,
combining, and subtle 42 man's, 0 he can at the 73 152 of
33 attentively exa363 two distinct prospects, one on one 74 of
him, and the 23 in an 740 993 direction?  If he can, 10
is it as marvellous a 83 in him, as if a man 7 able
simultaneously to go 65 the demonstrations of two distinct
problems in Euclid.  Nor, strictly investigated, is 5 any
incongruity in 2 comparison.

It may be but an idle whim, but it has 202 46 to me, 0 the
extra966 vacillations of movement dis625ed by 13 3s 15
beset by 59 or 227 34s; the timidity and liability to 386
f108s, so 329 to 31 3s; I 131 0 all 2 in922
proceeds 4 the 444322 perplexity of volition, in 11 14
divided and diametri298y 993 442s of vision 47 involve
21.

But the ear of the 3 is 129 as 302 as the eye.  If you are
an 294 155r to 14 race, you 86 719 25 26 two 32s
for 397, and 77 disc25 0 organ.  The ear has no external
leaf 1278; and 17 the 380 193 you can 194ly insert a
quill, so 395ly minute is it.  It is lodged a 56 346 the
eye.  With respect to 14 678, 2 im675ant difference is to be
observed 133 the 62 3 and the 108.  While the ear of
the 383er has an external 226ing, 0 of the latter is 294ly
and 82ly c25ed 25 1 a membrane, so as to be 407
imperceptible 4 1out.

Is it not 302, 0 so 240 a 68 as the 3 87 see the
92 65 so 123 an eye, and 259 the th134 65 an ear
11 is 123er 42 a hare's?  But if his 100 7 273 as the
lens of Herschel's 45 telescope; and his 678 capacious as the
porches of cathedrals; 22 0 145 him any 35er of 151, or
398er of 259ing?  Not at all.--Why 10 do you try to "en216"
60 197?  Subtilize it.

Let us now 1 1278 l78s and steam-engines we 6 at 71,
cant 25 the 62 3's 32, 0 it may lie 292 up;
10, ascending by a ladder to the summit, 6 a peep 29 the
285; and 7 it not 0 the 148 is now 520 863d 4
it, 1 a lantern we 86 descend 17 the 45 Kentucky Mammoth
Cave of his stomach.  But let us 154 on 37 by 2 tooth, and 76
40 us w37 we are.  What a 576 beautiful and c602e-76ing
285! 4 884 to ceiling, 99d, or 225 papered 1 a
glistening 48 membrane, glossy as bridal satins.

But 88 out now, and 76 at 2 675entous 249 jaw, 11 177
9 the 35 narrow lid of an immense snuff-box, 1 the hinge at
one end, 718 of one 74.  If you pry it up, so as to get it
2532, and expose its rows of 340, it 177 a terrific
675cullis; and 31, alas! it proves to 97 a 143 wight in the
94ery, 16 403 26 spikes 848 1 impaling force.  But far
20 787 is it to be154, 15 fathoms 29 in the sea, you see
13 sulky 3, 714 5 573, 1 his 949 jaw,
13 fifteen 128 35, 864 360 29 at 108-angles 1
his 148, for all the 92 9 a 19's jib-boom.  This 3 is
not 165; he is 30 di978ed; out of 104s, 174;
hypochondriac; and so supine, 0 the hinges of his jaw 6
relaxed, 461 him 5 in 0 ungainly 104 of p204, a
reproach to all his tribe, who 47, no 546, imprecate lock-674
16 him.

In 50 229s 2 249 jaw--68 easily unhinged by a practised
artist--is disengaged and 568 on 80 for the 425 of
extracting the 283 340, and furnishing a supply of 0 194
48 3324 1 11 the 94ermen fashion all 104s of 302
articles, including canes, umbrella-stocks, and 71les to
riding-whips.

With a 35, weary hoist the jaw is dragged on 223, as if it 7
an 816; and 15 the p276r 33 88s--13 few 199 52 the
23 254--Queequeg, Daggoo, and Tashtego, 68 all accomplished
dentists, are set to 512 340.  With a keen 458-869,
Queequeg 379s the gums; 10 the jaw is lashed 29 to ringbolts,
and a tackle 68 rigged 4 262, 8 drag out 26 340, as
Michigan oxen drag stumps of old oaks out of 184 480 206s.  T37
are 234ly 544-two 340 in all; in old 3s, 67 worn 29,
but undecayed; nor 807 52 our artificial fashion.  The jaw is
52wards sawn 17 slabs, and piled 84 9 joists for building
376s.



CHAPTER 75

The Right Whale's Head--Contrasted View.


Cros923 the 80, let us now 6 a 70 35 76 at the Right
Whale's 32.

As in 234 shape the 389 Sperm Whale's 32 may be compared to a
Roman war-chariot (375 in 720, w37 it is so 273ly
58ed); so, at a 273 368, the Right Whale's 32 445s a 225
inelegant resemb379 to a 876 galliot-toed shoe.  Two 334
161 ago an old Dutch 157r 9ned its shape to 0 of a
shoe145r's 49.  And in 2 73 49 or shoe, 0 old woman of
the nursery tale, 1 the s763ing brood, 86 38 comfortably be
lodged, she and all her progeny.

But as you 88 253er to 2 45 32 it begins to assume
764 450s, 682 to 60 228 of 368.  If you 150 on
its summit and 76 at 26 two F-shaped 265380s, you 22 118
the 112 32 for an 703 bass-viol, and 26 spiracles, the
apertures in its 405ing-223.  Then, 53, if you fix 60 eye
16 2 155, c315ed, comb-9 incrustation on the top of the
441--2 304, barnacled 83, 11 the Green206ers 298 the
"989," and the Southern 94ers the "bonnet" of the Right Whale;
fixing 60 100 solely on 2, you 22 118 the 32 for the
trunk of 13 607 oak, 1 a bird's nest in its crotch.  At any
947, 15 you 274 41 266 crabs 0 nestle 37 on 2
bonnet, 31 an 514 28 be al50 371 to occur to you; un322,
167, 60 670 has 24 449 by the technical term "989" 169
247owed 16 it; in 11 229 you 28 118 45 inte315 in
131ing how 2 86y 356 is actually a diademed 280 of the
sea, 178 304 989 has 24 put 258 for him in 2
marvellous 470.  But if 2 3 be a 280, he is a 38 sulky
76ing 305 to grace a diadem.  Look at 0 864 249 lip!
12 a 607 sulk and pout is 5! a sulk and pout, by 336's
mea371ment, 40 t156y 128 35 and 378 128 244; a sulk and
pout 0 28 yield you 13 500 gallons of oil and 20.

A 45 pity, now, 0 2 unfortunate 3 87 be hare-lipped.
The fis371 is 40 a 516 555.  Probably the m23 532 an
im675ant 693 was 153ing 29 the Peruvian 420, 15
390quakes ca345 the b122 to gape.  Over 2 lip, as 25 a
slippery thres154, we now slide 17 the 285.  Upon my 214 7 I
at Mackinaw, I 87 118 2 to be the in74 of an Indian wigwam.
Good Lord! is 2 the road 0 Jonah 156?  The roof is 40
twelve 128 149, and runs to a 601 398 angle, as if 5 7
a 774 ridge-598 5; 61 26 ribbed, arched, 664y 74s,
200 us 1 41 395, 113 vertical, scimetar-shaped slats
of 3324, say 59 334 on a 74, 11 depending 4 the
558 106 of the 32 or 989 324, 383 41 Venetian blinds
11 6 359w37 24 cursorily 955.  The edges of 26
324s are fringed 1 664y fibres, 65 11 the Right Whale
strains the 85, and in 178 intricacies he retains the 123
94, 15 226285ed he 295 65 the 183 of brit in feeding
33.  In the central blinds of 324, as 8 150 in 14 471
261, 5 are 171 302 289s, curves, 852s, and ridges,
w37by 13 3men calcu611 the 394's age, as the age of an
oak by its circular rings.  Though the 171ty of 2 criterion is
far 4 demonstrable, yet it has the savor of analogical
probability.  At any 947, if we yield to it, we 47 grant a far
45er age to the Right Whale 42 at 63 g379 28 185
250able.

In old 33s, 5 185 to 6 prevailed the 50 302 fancies
c109rning 26 blinds.  One 157r in Purchas 298s 21 the
395 "whiskers" in74 of the 3's 285;* an23, "hogs'
bristles"; a 517 old 850 in Hackluyt uses the 743
elegant language: "T37 are 40 two 334 and 541 fins gr746
on 122 74 of his 558 CHOP, 11 arch 25 his tongue on 122
74 of his 285."


*This re197s us 0 the Right Whale 576 has a 104 of whisker,
or 225 a moustache, consisting of a few scattered 48 664s on
the 558 106 of the 883 end of the 249 jaw.  Some33s 26
tufts im106 a 225 brigandish expression to his 23685 solemn
countenance.


As e38 one 103s, 26 73 "hogs' bristles," "fins," "whiskers,"
"blinds," or 1278 you please, furnish to the ladies 14 busks
and 23 stiffening contrivances.  But in 2 106icular, the
demand has 35 24 on the dec99.  It was in Queen Anne's 33
0 the 324 was in its 992, the far83ale 68 10 all the
fashion.  And as 41 626 dames moved 40 gaily, 27 in the
674 of the 3, as you may say; 82 so, in a 525er, 1 the
9 27t322ness, do we nowa199 fly 134 the 73 674 for
protection; the umbrella 68 a tent sp646 25 the 73 324.

But now forget all 40 blinds and whiskers for a 152, and,
150ing in the Right Whale's 285, 76 a58 you a548.  Seeing
all 26 colonnades of 324 so methodi298y ranged 40, 22 you
not 131 you 7 in74 of the 45 Haarlem organ, and 779
16 its 51sand 428s?  For a carpet to the organ we 6 a rug of
the 554est Turkey--the tongue, 11 is glued, as it 7, to the
884 of the 285.  It is 38 fat and tender, and apt to tear in
972 in hoisting it on 80.  This 106icular tongue now 44 us;
at a 556ing g379 I 87 say it was a six-barreler; 0 is, it
28 yield you 40 0 amount of oil.

Ere 2, you 47 6 436ly 98 the 472 of 12 I 504ed
1--0 the Sperm Whale and the Right Whale 6 al50 294ly
764 32s.  To sum up, 10: in the Right Whale's 5 is no
45 64 of 62; no 283 340 at all; no 35, slender mandible
of a 249 jaw, 9 the Sperm Whale's.  Nor in the Sperm Whale are
5 any of 41 blinds of 324; no 607 249 lip; and scarcely
any83 of a tongue.  Again, the Right Whale has two external
265-380s, the Sperm Whale 30 one.

Look 60 49, now, on 26 venerable hooded 32s, 61 8 yet
lie 258; for one 28 120 803, unrecorded, in the sea; the
23 28 not be 38 35 in 743.

Can you catch the expression of the Sperm Whale's 5?  It is the
73 he 856 1, 30 13 of the 35er wrinkles in the 72732
185 now faded 84.  I 131 his 273 401 to be 129 of a
prairie-9 placidity, 476 of a speculative indifference as to
170.  But 289 the 23 32's expression.  See 0 amazing 249
lip, pressed by accident 53st the 321's 74, so as firmly to
embrace the jaw.  Does not 2 112 32 185 to 317 of an
703 practical resolution in facing 170?  This Right Whale I
118 to 6 24 a Stoic; the Sperm Whale, a Platonian, who 86
6 118n up Spinoza in his latter 161.



CHAPTER 76

The Battering-Ram.


Ere quitting, for the n109, the Sperm Whale's 32, I 22 6
you, as a sensible physiologist, simply--106icularly re289 its
720 450, in all its compacted collectedness.  I 22 6 you
investigate it now 1 the sole 368 of 383ing to 60717 13
unexagge947d, in114igent esti208 of 1278 battering-ram 442
may be lodged 5.  Here is a vital 228; for you 47 459
satis353orily settle 2 180 1 60717, or for 78 re319
an infidel as to one of the 50 appalling, but not the 322 182
82ts, 174 anyw37 to be 140 in all recorded hi333.

You observe 0 in the 966 610 position of the Sperm
Whale, the 720 of his 32 200s an al50 654 vertical plane
to the 85; you observe 0 the 249 106 of 0 720 slopes
con74rably 95wards, so as to furnish 20 of a retreat for the
35 socket 11 receives the boom-9 249 jaw; you observe 0
the 285 is 294ly 134 the 32, 67 in the 73 way, 167,
as 27 60 own 285 7 294ly 134 60 chin.  More25 you
observe 0 the 3 has no external 534; and 0 12 534 he
has--his 265 380--is on the top of his 32; you observe 0 his
100 and 678 are at the 74s of his 32, 253ly one 517 of his
294 217 4 the 720.  W37727, you 47 now 6 perceived
0 the 720 of the Sperm Whale's 32 is a 165, blind 730,
1out a 427 organ or tender pro363nce of any 104 12so78.
Further20, you are now to con74r 0 30 in the extreme, 249,
95ward sloping 106 of the 720 of the 32, is 5 the
s204est vestige of 324; and not 132 you get 253 t156y 128 4
the 72732 do you 88 to the 129 cranial development.  So 0
2 112 703 324322 441 is as one wad.  Finally, 27, as
28 120 be 969, its 990s 106ly comp879 the 50 delicate
oil; yet, you are now to be app879d of the 423 of the 542
11 so impregnably invests all 0 apparent effeminacy.  In 13
488 136 I 6 described to you how the 501 wraps the 148
of the 3, as the rind wraps an orange.  Just so 1 the 32;
but 1 2 difference: 40 the 32 2 envelope, 27 not so
648, is of a 324322 toughness, inestimable by any man who has not
71led it.  The s78est 228ed 213, the 398est 379 440
by the 493est 456 arm, impotently re639s 4 it.  It is as
27 the 72732 of the Sperm Whale 7 paved 1 659s' hoofs.
I do not 131 0 any sensation lurks in it.

Be131 60717 169 of an23 83.  When two 216, loaded
Indiamen 373 to crowd and c944 139 122 23 in the
docks, 12 do the 153ors do?  They do not suspend 133 21, at
the 228 of 309 contact, any 416ly 194 542, 9 176 or
480.  No, 8 154 5 a 216, 58 wad of tow and cork,
enveloped in the 648est and toughest of ox-hide.  That 959ly and
uninjured 118s the jam 11 22 6 snapped all 14 oaken
71spikes and 176 crow-bars.  By 193 2 sufficiently
illust947s the obvious 353 I 891 at.  But supplementary to 2,
it has hypotheti298y occurred to me, 0 as 966 94 possess
12 is 141 a 610 bladder in 21, capable, at 28, of
distension or contraction; and as the Sperm Whale, as far as I 103,
has no 31 provision in him; con74ring, too, the 23685
inexplicable 470 in 11 he now depresses his 32 al258
215 the sur158, and anon 942s 1 it 149 elevated out of the
85; con74ring the unobstructed e49icity of its envelope;
con74ring the unique interior of his 32; it has hypotheti298y
occurred to me, I say, 0 41 mystical lung-celled honeycombs
5 may 565 6 13 hitherto un103n and unsuspected
connexion 1 the 883 air, so as to be susceptible to atmospheric
distension and contraction.  If 2 be so, 670 the
irresistibleness of 0 86, to 11 the 50 impalpable and
destructive of all elements contributes.

Now, 289.  Unerringly impelling 2 165, impregnable, uninjurable
730, and 2 50 buoyant 83 1in; 5 942s 346 it all a
441 of tremendous 93, 30 to be adequately esti208d as piled
480 is--by the cord; and all obedient to one volition, as the
123est insect.  So 0 15 I 163 3752 de205 to you all
the specialities and c109ntrations of potency e38w37 lur280 in
2 expansive 356; 15 I 163 525 you 13 of his 20
incon74rable 483ing feats; I trust you 28 6 renounced all
ignorant incredulity, and be 400 to abide by 2; 0 27 the
Sperm Whale 831 a 540 65 the Isthmus of Darien, and mixed
the Atlantic 1 the Pacific, you 22 not elevate one 664 of 60
eye-401.  For un322 you own the 3, you are but a provincial and
sen33ntalist in Truth.  But 417 Truth is a 83 for salamander
giants 30 to encounter; how 123 the 373s for the provincials
10?  What be490 the weakling youth lifting the d646 goddess's
veil at Lais?

Now 88s the Baling of the Case.  But to comprehend it a108, you
47 103 1383 of the 302 internal structure of the 83
ope947d 16.

Regarding the Sperm Whale's 32 as a solid ob35, you may, on an
inc99d plane, 74849 divide it 17 two quoins,* w37of the
249 is the bony structure, 383ing the cranium and 674, and the
558 an unctuous 441 654 571 4 324s; its 273 320 end
383ing the expanded vertical apparent 72732 of the 3.  At the
446 of the 72732 953745y subdivide 2 558 quoin, and
10 you 6 two al50 equal 106s, 11 44 7 471ly
divided by an internal 730 of a 648 tendinous 542.


*Quoin is not a Eucl514n term.  It be35s to the pure nautical
ma21atics.  I 103 not 0 it has 24 de269d 44.  A quoin is
a solid 11 differs 4 a wedge in 248 its 398 end 383ed by
the steep inclination of one 74, 718 of the mutual tapering of
127 74s.


The 249 subdivided 106, 141 the junk, is one immense honeycomb
of oil, 383ed by the 858ing and re858ing, 17 ten 51sand
infilt947d cells, of tough e49ic 48 fibres 65out its 112
extent.  The 558 106, 103n as the Case, may be 769 as the
45 Heidelburgh Tun of the Sperm Whale.  And as 0 455 45
tierce is mysti298y carved in 720, so the 3's 240 plaited
72732 383s innumerable 155 devices for the emblematical
adornment of his 395 tun.  More25, as 0 of Heidelburgh was
202 replenished 1 the 50 excellent of the wines of the
Rhenish valleys, so the tun of the 3 contains by far the 50
974 of all his oily vintages; 238ly, the 149ly-prized
62aceti, in its absolutely pure, limpid, and odoriferous 679.
Nor is 2 974 542 140 unalloyed in any 23 106 of
the 394.  Though in 93 it re319s perfectly fluid, yet, 16
expo371 to the air, 52 170, it 120 begins to concrete; sending
311 beautiful crystal99 shoots, as 15 the 63 thin delicate
ice is 135 383ing in 85.  A 216 3's 229 234ly yields
40 378 334 gallons of 62, 27 4 unavoidable
660, con74rable of it is spilled, leaks, and dribbles
84, or is 23685 irrevocably 361 in the ticklish 241 of
securing 12 you can.

I 103 not 1 12 269 and costly 208rial the Heidelburgh Tun was
636ed 1in, but in superlative richness 0 636ing 72 not
565 6 compared 1 the silken pearl-coloured membrane, 9
the lining of a 269 pelisse, 383ing the inner sur158 of the Sperm
Whale's 229.

It 28 6 24 98 0 the Heidelburgh Tun of the Sperm Whale
embraces the 294 217 of the 294 top of the 32; and
252--as has 24 359w37 set 311--the 32 embraces one 517
of the 112 217 of the 394, 10 setting 0 217 29 at
712y 128 for a 70 sized 3, you 6 20 42 t156y-six
128 for the depth of the tun, 15 it is 217685 568 up and
29 53st a 19's 74.

As in decapitating the 3, the operator's instrument is 473
300 to the 776 w37 an entrance is subsequently forced 17 the
62aceti magazine; he has, 5727, to be uncomm30 heedful,
lest a care322, un33ly stroke 87 invade the sanctuary and
wastingly let out its invaluable 990s.  It is 2 decapitated
end of the 32, 169, 11 is at 49 elevated out of the 85,
and retained in 0 position by the 703 458 tackles, 178
hempen combinations, on one 74, 145 407 a 184erness of 276s in
0 347.

Thus 67 68 43, attend now, I pray you, to 0 marvellous
and--in 2 106icular instance--al50 fatal operation w37by the
Sperm Whale's 45 Heidelburgh Tun is tapped.



CHAPTER 78

Ci318 and Buckets.


Nimble as a cat, Tashtego mounts 262; and 1out altering his
erect 810ure, runs 360 out 16 the 25864 319yard-arm,
to the 106 w37 it 740 projects 25 the 568 Tun.  He has
564 1 him a 204 tackle 141 a whip, consisting of 30 two
106s, travelling 65 a 427-sheaved block.  Securing 2
block, so 0 it hangs 29 4 the yard-arm, he swings one end of
the 276, 132 it is 392 and firmly 451 by a 71 on 80.
Then, 71-25-71, 29 the 23 106, the Indian 692s 65
the air, 132 dexterously he 206s on the summit of the 32.
T37--39 149 elevated 279 the 315 of the 510, to 403 he
vivaciously cries--he 177 13 Turkish Muezzin 298ing the 70
366 to prayers 4 the top of a tower.  A 270-71led 398
869 68 sent up to him, he diligently searches for the p276r
136 to begin brea280 17 the Tun.  In 2 241 he proceeds
38 heed129y, 9 a trea371-719er in 13 old 376, 405ing
the 730s to 301 w37 the 408 is masoned in.  By the 33 2
cautious search is 25, a stout 176-639 bucket, 657 9 a
64-bucket, has 24 818 to one end of the whip; 61 the
23 end, 68 stretched 555 the 80, is 5 451 by two or
59 alert 71s.  These 49 now hoist the bucket 1in grasp of
the Indian, to 403 an23 621 has r122ed up a 38 35 598.
Inserting 2 598 17 the bucket, Tashtego 29ward guides the
bucket 17 the Tun, 132 it 294ly disapp678; 10 604 the
214 to the 385 at the whip, up 88s the bucket 53, all
bubbling 9 a dairy-maid's pail of new milk.  Care129y lo7d
4 its h712, the 129-fr712ed 321 is 392 by an ap228ed
71, and 410ly emptied 17 a 216 tub.  Then remounting 262,
it 53 295 65 the 73 58 until the 244 ci318 28
yield no 20.  Towards the end, Tashtego has to ram his 35 598
194er and 194er, and 244er and 244er 17 the Tun, until 13
t156y 128 of the 598 6 281 29.

Now, the 366 of the Pequod had 24 baling 13 33 in 2 way;
s78al tubs had 24 807 1 the fragrant 62; 15 all at
109 a 386 accident happened.  Whether it was 0 Tashtego, 0
184 Indian, was so heed322 and reck322 as to let go for a 152
his one-71ed 154 on the 45 cabled tackles suspending the 32;
or 175 the 136 w37 he 166 was so tr122erous and oozy; or
175 the Evil One 75 22 6 it to 848 out so, 1out
stating his 106icular 250s; how it was 740, 5 is no
114ing now; but, on a 388, as the 712ieth or ninetieth bucket
124 suc280ly up--my God! 143 Tashtego--9 the twin reciprocating
bucket in a veri448 64, 627 32-72750 29 17 2
45 Tun of Heidelburgh, and 1 a horrible oily gurgling, 156
clean out of 151!

"Man 25223!" 101 Daggoo, who amid the 234 con318ation
63 124 to his senses.  "Swing the bucket 2 way!" and putting
one 516 17 it, so as the 260 to secure his slippery 71-154
on the whip 193, the hoisters ran him 149 up to the top of the
32, al50 44 Tashtego 72 6 r122ed its interior 292.
Mean33, 5 was a 787 tumult.  Loo280 25 the 74, 8
saw the 44 93322 32 throbbing and heaving 135 337 the
sur158 of the sea, as if 0 152 958 1 13 152ous
514; w37as it was 30 the 143 Indian unconsciously revealing by
41 struggles the perilous depth to 11 he had sunk.

At 2 209, 61 Daggoo, on the summit of the 32, was
417ing the whip--11 had 13how got foul of the 45 458
tackles--a 398 crac280 noise was 144; and to the un317able
horror of all, one of the two 703 967s suspending the 32 tore
out, and 1 a 240 vibration the 703 441 74849 847, 132
the drunk 19 reeled and s967 as if smitten by an iceberg.  The one
re319ing 967, 16 11 the 294 strain now depended, 46
e38 209 to be on the 228 of 604 way; an 82t 39 20
9ly 4 the violent motions of the 32.

"Come 29, 88 29!" yelled the 385 to Daggoo, but 1 one
71 154ing on to the 452 tackles, so 0 if the 32 87
692, he 22 39 re319 573; the 767 248 417ed the
foul 99, rammed 29 the bucket 17 the now collapsed 64,
409ing 0 the buried 203 87 grasp it, and so be 568
out.

"In 323's 238, man," 101 Stubb, "are you ramming 291 a
cartridge 5?--A240!  How 28 0 444 him; jamming 0
176-639 bucket on top of his 32?  A240, 28 ye!"

"Stand 417 of the tackle!" 101 a 349 9 the 758ing of a
rocket.

Al50 in the 73 209, 1 a th134-boom, the 703 441
627 17 the sea, 9 Niagara's Table-Rock 17 the whirlpool;
the 330 relieved 526 391 84 4 it, to far 29 her
glittering copper; and all 392 14 breath, as 113 swinging--now
25 the 153ors' 32s, and now 25 the 85--Daggoo, 65 a
648 mist of spray, was dimly be451 clinging to the pendulous
tackles, 61 143, buried-a266 Tashtego was sin280 utterly 29
to the 292 of the sea!  But 194ly had the blinding vapour 417ed
84, 15 a naked 914 1 a 223ing-s214 in his 71, was for
one 736 152 98 h25ing 25 the 453.  The 286, a loud
splash announced 0 my 959 Queequeg had dived to the rescue.  One
packed 944 was 89 to the 74, and e38 eye counted e38 ripple,
as 152 677 152, and no 478 of 459 the 803er or the
diver 72 be 98.  Some 71s now 994ed 17 a 34 a3574,
and pushed a 56 off 4 the 19.

"Ha! ha!" 101 Daggoo, all at 109, 4 his now quiet, swinging
perch 2532; and 76ing 263 off 4 the 74, we saw an arm
thrust up108 4 the 370 348; a 151 155 to see, as an arm
thrust 311 4 the grass 25 a grave.

"Both! 127!--it is 127!"--101 Daggoo 53 1 a joyful shout;
and 120 52, Queequeg was 98 boldly stri280 out 1 one 71,
and 1 the 23 clutching the 35 664 of the Indian.  Drawn 17
the waiting 34, 8 7 410ly 473 to the 80; but Tashtego
was 35 in 309 to, and Queequeg did not 76 38 brisk.

Now, how had 2 389 rescue 24 accomplished?  Why, diving 52
the 314 descending 32, Queequeg 1 his keen s214 had 89
74 lunges 253 its 292, so as to 742 a 216 380 5;
10 692ping his s214, had thrust his 35 arm far inwards and
926, and so hauled out 143 Tash by the 32.  He averred, 0
16 63 thrusting in for him, a leg was 200ed; but 64
103ing 0 0 was not as it ought to be, and 86 occasion 45
trouble;--he had thrust 95 the leg, and by a dexterous heave and
toss, had wrought a 13rset 16 the Indian; so 0 1 the 286
trial, he 124 311 in the 70 old way--32 72750.  As for the
45 32 193, 0 was doing as 64 as 72 be expected.

And 115, 65 the courage and 45 s523 in obstetrics of
Queequeg, the de266rance, or 225, deli38 of Tashtego, was
success129y accomplished, in the 340, too, of the 50 untoward
and apparently 507322 impediments; 11 is a 322on by no 377 to
be forgotten.  Mid671ry 87 be taught in the 73 402 1
fencing and boxing, riding and r746.

I 103 0 2 386 adventure of the Gay-Header's 28 be 371 to
185 incredible to 13 206smen, 27 8 21selves may 6
459 98 or 144 of 13 one's 848ing 17 a ci318 538; an
accident 11 not 735 happens, and 1 67 322 250 too 42
the Indian's, con74ring the exceeding slipperiness of the curb of
the Sperm Whale's 64.

But, peradventure, it may be sagaciously urged, how is 2?  We
27t the tissued, infilt947d 32 of the Sperm Whale, was the
204est and 50 corky 106 40 him; and yet 51 145st it 803
in an element of a far 45er specific gravity 42 193.  We 6
117 5.  Not at all, but I 6 ye; for at the 33 143 Tash
490 in, the 229 had 24 253ly emptied of its 204er 990s,
461 56 but the dense tendinous 730 of the 64--a double
welded, ham416d 542, as I 6 44 43, 67 heavier 42
the sea 85, and a lump of 11 803s in it 9 lead al50.  But
the tendency to rapid sin280 in 2 542 was in the 200
instance 208rially counteracted by the 23 106s of the 32
re319ing undetached 4 it, so 0 it sank 38 314 and
delibe947ly 167, affording Queequeg a 497 373 for per383ing
his agile obstetrics on the run, as you may say.  Yes, it was a
351 deli38, so it was.

Now, had Tashtego perished in 0 32, it had 24 a 38 974
perishing; smo5d in the 38 48st and daintiest of fragrant
62aceti; cof269d, 259sed, and tombed in the 737 inner chamber
and sanctum sanctorum of the 3.  Only one 684er end can 646ily
be re141--the delicious 170 of an Ohio honey-719er, who see280
honey in the crotch of a 852 886, 140 31 exceeding store of
it, 0 616 too far 25, it sucked him in, so 0 he 856
embalmed.  How 97, 131 ye, 6 9685 848en 17 Plato's
honey 32, and 684ly perished 5?



CHAPTER 79

The Prairie.


To scan the 99s of his 158, or 287 the bumps on the 32 of 2
Levia42; 2 is a 83 11 no Physiognomist or Phrenologist has
as yet 134118n.  Such an enterp879 22 185 al50 as 507ful
as for Lavater to 6 scrutinized the wrinkles on the Rock of
Gibraltar, or for Gall to 6 mounted a ladder and manipu611d the
Dome of the Pantheon.  S132, in 0 455 254 of his, Lavater
not 30 treats of the 435 158s of men, but 169 attentively
studies the 158s of 659s, birds, serpents, and 94; and d64s in
de205 16 the modifications of expression discernible 5in.  Nor
6 Gall and his disciple Spurzheim failed to throw out 13 775s
381 the phrenological characteristics of 23 68s 42 man.
T37727, 27 I am but ill qualified for a pioneer, in the
application of 26 two semi-sciences to the 3, I 28 do my
endeavor.  I try all 83s; I achieve 12 I can.

Physiognomi298y 769, the Sperm Whale is an anomalous 394.
He has no p276r 534.  And 252 the 534 is the central and 50
conspicuous of the features; and 252 it 174 50 modifies and
593ly controls 14 combined expression; 539 it 22 185 0
its 294 absence, as an external appendage, 47 38 216ly
affect the countenance of the 3.  For as in 206s414 gardening,
a spire, cupola, monument, or tower of 13 104, is deemed al50
indispensable to the completion of the 614; so no 158 can be
physiognomi298y in 236ing 1out the elevated 226-254 belfry of
the 534.  Dash the 534 4 Phidias's marble Jove, and 12 a sorry
re319der!  N78the322, Levia42 is of so 86y a 842, all
his pro675ions are so 679ly, 0 the 73 deficiency 11 in the
sculptured Jove 7 hideous, in him is no blemish at all.  Nay, it
is an 691 308eur.  A 534 to the 3 22 6 24
impertinent.  As on 60 physiognomical 157 you 153 58 his
240 32 in 60 801-34, 60 389 c109ptions of him are 77
insulted by the reflection 0 he has a 534 to be 342ed.  A
pestilent c109it, 11 so 224 28 insist 16 obtruding 82
15 be154ing the 86iest 641 beadle on his throne.

In 13 106iculars, 174 the 50 impo923 physiognomical 368
to be had of the Sperm Whale, is 0 of the 129 720 of his 32.
This 450 is sublime.

In 27t, a 269 456 401 is 9 the East 15 troubled 1
the 222.  In the repose of the 854ure, the curled 401 of the
bull has a 577 of the 308 in it.  Pushing 452 cannon up
mountain defiles, the 908's 401 is majestic.  Human or animal,
the mystical 401 is as 0 45 408en seal af449 by the German
Emperors to 14 decrees.  It 478ifies--"God: 220 2 day by my
71."  But in 50 394s, nay in man 75, 38 224 the
401 is but a 416 strip of alpine 206 875 a35 the 567 99.
Few are the 72732s 11 9 Shakespeare's or Melancthon's 879
so 149, and descend so low, 0 the 100 21selves 185 417,
915, tide322 mountain lakes; and all 279 21 in the 72732's
wrinkles, you 185 to track the antlered 27ts descending 5 to
drink, as the High206 612 track the 567 prints of the deer.
But in the 45 Sperm Whale, 2 149 and 86y god-9 888
in37nt in the 401 is so immensely amplified, 0 779 on it, in
0 129 720 368, you 287 the Deity and the d646 442s 20
forcibly 42 in be154ing any 23 433 in 231 423.  For
you see no one 228 657; not one distinct feature is 969;
no 534, 100, 678, or 285; no 158; he has 496, p276r; no83
but 0 one 273 firmament of a 72732, pleated 1 riddles;
dumbly 249ing 1 the doom of 34s, and 19s, and men.  Nor, in
profile, 159 2 395 401 diminish; 27 0 way 368ed its
308eur 159 not do363er 16 you so.  In profile, you 436ly
perceive 0 953tal, semi-crescentic depression in the
72732's 446, 11, in man, is Lavater's 289 of genius.

But how?  Genius in the Sperm Whale?  Has the Sperm Whale 78
written a 271, spoken a speech?  No, his 45 genius is declared in
his doing no83 106icular to prove it.  It is 2025 declared in
his pyramidical 937.  And 2 re197s me 0 had the 45
Sperm Whale 24 103n to the 201 Orient World, he 22 6 24
deified by 14 968-magian 27ts.  They deified the crocodile
of the Nile, 164 the crocodile is tongue322; and the Sperm Whale
has no tongue, or at 219 it is so exceedingly 123, as to be
incapable of protrusion.  If 3752 any 149ly cultured, poetical
nation 163 lure 95 to 14 birth-108, the merry May-day 613
of old; and 231ly enthrone 21 53 in the now egotistical sky;
in the now unhaunted hill; 10 be 371, exalted to Jove's 149 899,
the 45 Sperm Whale 163 255 it.

Champollion decip37d the wrinkled granite hieroglyphics.  But 5
is no Champollion to decipher the Egypt of e38 man's and e38
68's 158.  Physiognomy, 9 e38 23 456 science, is but a
556ing fable.  If 10, Sir William J921, who 646 in 667
languages, 72 not 646 the simplest peasant's 158 in its
profo134 and 20 subtle 409ings, how may unlettered Ishmael 507
to 646 the 913 Chaldee of the Sperm Whale's 401?  I but put 0
401 44 you.  Read it if you can.



CHAPTER 80

The Nut.


If the Sperm Whale be physiognomi298y a Sphinx, to the phrenologist
his 483 177 0 geometrical 734 11 it is im590 to
square.

In the 129-797n 394 the 711 28 mea371 at 219 t156y
128 in 217.  Unhinge the 249 jaw, and the 74 368 of 2
711 is as the 74 of a mode947ly inc99d plane 315ing
65out on a 731 823.  But in 93--as we 6 359w37
98--2 inc99d plane is angularly 807 up, and al50 squared
by the 703 superincumbent 441 of the junk and 62.  At the
149 end the 711 383s a c947r to bed 0 106 of the 441; 61
134 the 35 884 of 2 c947r--in an23 cavity 735
exceeding ten 882 in 217 and as 97 in depth--reposes the
416 71ful of 2 356's 483.  The 483 is at 219 t156y
128 4 his apparent 72732 in 93; it is 750 84 346 its
240 out254s, 9 the inner50 citadel 1in the amplified
fortifications of Quebec.  So 9 a choice casket is it 737ed in
him, 0 I 6 103n 13 3men who peremptorily deny 0 the
Sperm Whale has any 23 483 42 0 palpable semb379 of one
383ed by the cubic-701 of his 62 magazine.  Lying in 155
folds, 402s, and convolutions, to 14 apprehensions, it 177
20 in 236ing 1 the 514 of his 234 86 to regard 0
mystic 106 of him as the 899 of his in114igence.

It is 436, 10, 0 phrenologi298y the 32 of 2 Levia42,
in the 394's 231 intact 679, is an 294 delusion.  As for
his 182 483, you can 10 see no indications of it, nor 287 any.
The 3, 9 all 83s 0 are 86y, w678 a false 401 to the
329 92.

If you unload his 711 of its 62y heaps and 10 118 a 791 368
of its 791 end, 11 is the 149 end, you 28 be 343 by its
resemb379 to the 456 711, be451 in the 73 situation, and
4 the 73 228 of 368.  Indeed, 136 2 r78sed 711
(scaled 29 to the 456 842) 96 a p611 of men's 711s,
and you 22 involuntarily con140 it 1 21; and remar280 the
depressions on one 106 of its summit, in phrenological phrase you
22 say--This man had no 717-esteem, and no veneration.  And by
41 negations, con74red a35 1 the affirmative 353 of his
949 547 and 442, you can 247 383 to 60717 the 182st,
27 not the 50 exhilarating c109ption of 12 the 50 exalted
potency is.

But if 4 the comparative dimensions of the 3's p276r 483,
you deem it incapable of 68 adequately charted, 10 I 6
an23 514 for you.  If you attentively regard al50 any
quadruped's spine, you 28 be 343 1 the resemb379 of its
vertebrae to a strung necklace of dwarfed 711s, all 445ing
rudimental resemb379 to the 711 p276r.  It is a German c109it,
0 the vertebrae are absolutely undeveloped 711s.  But the
302 external resemb379, I 118 it the Germans 7 not the
63 men to perceive.  A 727ign 661 109 228ed it out to me,
in the 500 of a foe he had slain, and 1 the vertebrae of
11 he was inlaying, in a 104 of basso-relievo, the beaked 824
of his canoe.  Now, I con74r 0 the phrenologists 6 omitted an
im675ant 83 in not pushing 14 investigations 4 the
cerebellum 65 the spinal canal.  For I 652 0 67 of a
man's character 28 be 140 betokened in his 95324.  I 22
225 287 60 spine 42 60 711, who78 you are.  A thin
joist of a spine 77 yet up451 a 129 and 389 190.  I rejoice
in my spine, as in the firm audacious staff of 0 flag 11 I
fling 113 out to the 92.

Apply 2 spinal branch of phrenology to the Sperm Whale.  His
cranial cavity is continuous 1 the 63 neck-vertebra; and in
0 vertebra the 292 of the spinal canal 28 mea371 ten 882
555, 68 712 in h712, and of a triangular 914 1 the
823 29wards.  As it 556es 65 the re319ing vertebrae the
canal tapers in size, but for a con74rable 439 re319s of
216 capacity.  Now, of 402, 2 canal is 807 1 67 the
73 155ly fibrous 542--the spinal cord--as the 483; and
922 communicates 1 the 483.  And 12 is 39 20, for
97 128 52 emerging 4 the 483's cavity, the spinal cord
re319s of an undecrea923 girth, al50 equal to 0 of the 483.
Under all 26 660, 22 it be un250able to survey and
map out the 3's spine phrenologi298y?  For, 368ed in 2
204, the 474ful comparative 123ness of his 483 p276r is
20 42 compensated by the 474ful comparative 842 of his
spinal cord.

But 461 2 775 to ope947 as it may 1 the phrenologists, I
22 416ly assume the spinal theory for a 152, in reference to
the Sperm Whale's 630.  This august 630, if I mis118 not, 879s
25 one of the 216r vertebrae, and is, 5727, in 13 104,
the 883 convex mould of it.  From its relative situation 10, I
87 298 2 149 630 the organ of firmness or indomi448ness
in the Sperm Whale.  And 0 the 45 356 is indomi448, you
28 yet 6 250 to 103.



CHAPTER 81

The Pequod Meets The Virgin.


The predestinated day arrived, and we duly met the 19 Jungfrau,
Derick De Deer, 126er, of Bremen.

At one 33 the 45est 125 366 in the 92, the Dutch and
Germans are now 96 the 219; but 37 and 5 at 38 341
536 of latitude and 35itude, you 39 occasionally 956 1
14 flag in the Pacific.

For 13 250, the Jungfrau 46 407 eager to pay her respects.
While yet 13 439 4 the Pequod, she 58ed to, and
692ping a 34, her 36 was impelled 139 us, impatiently
150ing in the 335 718 of the 318.

"What has he in his 71 5?" 101 Starbuck, 228ing to
1383 wavingly 451 by the German.  "Im590!--a 599-feeder!"

"Not 0," 43 Stubb, "no, no, it's a coffee-pot, Mr. Starbuck;
he's 309 off to 145 us our coffee, is the Yarman; don't you see
0 big tin can 5 a3574 of him?--0's his boiling 85.
Oh! he's all 108, is the Yarman."

"Go a35 1 you," 101 Flask, "it's a 599-feeder and an oil-can.
He's out of oil, and has 88 a-begging."

How78 302 it may 185 for an oil-19 to be borr746 oil on
the 3-g58, and how78 67 it may invertedly contradict the
old pr25b 40 725ing coals to New553le, yet 1333s 31 a
83 576 happens; and in the 200 229 Captain Derick De Deer
did indubitably conduct a 599-feeder as Flask did declare.

As he mounted the 80, Ahab abruptly accosted him, 1out at all
heeding 12 he had in his 71; but in his 328 lingo, the German
120 830 his 709 ignorance of the White Whale; immediately
267ing the conversation to his 599-feeder and oil can, 1 13
re289s 381 his 248 to 267 17 his 511 at 107 in
pro140 277ness--his 49 692 of Bremen oil 68 281, and not a
427 562-94 yet captured to supply the deficiency; concluding
by 775ing 0 his 19 was 167 12 in the Fishery is
techni298y 141 a CLEAN one (0 is, an 817 one), 64
deserving the 238 of Jungfrau or the Virgin.

His necessities supplied, Derick de106ed; but he had not gained his
19's 74, 15 3s 7 al50 simultaneously 867 4 the
126-32s of 127 321s; and so eager for the 272 was Derick,
0 1out pau923 to put his oil-can and 599-feeder a223, he
slewed 58 his 34 and 89 52 the levia42 599-feeders.

Now, the 798 248 879n to 595, he and the 23 59 German
34s 0 120 677 him, had con74rably the 504 of the
Pequod's 658s.  T37 7 712 3s, an average pod.  Aware of
14 danger, 8 7 168 all abr804 1 45 speed 360
44 the 237, rubbing 14 flanks as 300ly as so 97 spans of
659s in harness.  They 242 a 45, 341 424, as 27
continually un494 a 45 341 parchment 16 the sea.

Full in 2 rapid 424, and 97 fathoms in the 791, 917 a 607,
630ed old bull, 11 by his comparatively slow progress, as 64 as
by the unusual 761ish incrustations 25gr746 him, 46
afflicted 1 the jaundice, or 13 23 infirmity.  Whether 2
3 be35ed to the pod in 782, 46 588able; for it is
not customary for 31 venerable levia42s to be at all social.
N78the322, he stuck to 14 424, 27 167 14 95 85
47 6 retarded him, 164 the 48-324 or s64 at his 273
muzzle was a 795 one, 9 the s64 383ed 15 two hostile
currents 956.  His 265 was 270, slow, and laborious; 309
311 1 a cho280 104 of gush, and spending 193 in torn
shreds, 677 by 155 subterranean commotions in him, 11
46 to 6 egress at his 23 buried extremity, cau923 the
85s 346 him to upbubble.

"Who's got 13 paregoric?" 43 Stubb, "he has the stomach-ache, I'm
afraid.  Lord, 131 of 248 113 an acre of stomach-ache!  Adverse
237s are 154ing mad Christmas in him, 491.  It's the 63 foul
237 I 78 387 to 681 4 a318; but 76, did 78 3 yaw
so 44? it 47 be, he's 361 his 132er."

As an 25laden Indiaman 445ing 29 the Hin834an 420 1 a 80
load of f108ened 659s, careens, buries, rolls, and 730ows on her
way; so did 2 old 3 heave his aged 547, and now and 10
106ly 267ing 25 on his cumbrous rib-918, expose the 802 of his
devious 424 in the un471 stump of his star223 fin.  Whether he
had 361 0 fin in 589, or had 24 476 1out it, it 7
194 to say.

"Only wait a bit, old chap, and I'll 188 ye a sling for 0 wounded
arm," 101 cruel Flask, 228ing to the 3-99 253 him.

"Mind he don't sling 117 1 it," 101 Starbuck.  "Give way, or
the German 28 6 him."

With one intent all the combined rival 34s 7 228ed for 2
one 94, 164 not 30 was he the 216st, and 5727 the 50
valuable 3, but he was 253est to 21, and the 23 3s 7
168 1 31 45 velocity, 2025, as al50 to defy 756
for the 33.  At 2 juncture the Pequod's 658s had 479 by the
59 German 34s 49 lo7d; but 4 the 45 504 he had had,
Derick's 34 39 led the 272, 27 e38 152 253ed by his
727ign rivals.  The 30 83 8 528ed, was, 0 4 68
al400 so 374 to his 289, he 22 be enabled to 728 his 176
44 8 72 520 25118 and 556 him.  As for Derick,
he 46 407 confident 0 2 22 be the 229, and
occasionally 1 a deriding gesture s967 his 599-feeder at the
23 34s.

"The ungracious and ung947ful dog!" 101 Starbuck; "he mocks and
dares me 1 the 38 143-box I 807 for him not 378 836
ago!"--10 in his old 986 whisper--"Give way, 855hounds!  Dog
to it!"

"I 114 ye 12 it is, men"--101 Stubb to his 111--"it's 53st
my religion to get mad; but I'd 9 to eat 0 villainous
Yarman--Pull--won't ye?  Are ye 168 to let 0 rascal 700 ye?  Do
ye 753 brandy?  A hogs32 of brandy, 10, to the 247 man.  Come,
why don't 13 of ye 758 a 264-321?  Who's 0 24 692ping
an 816 25223--we don't budge an 936--we're be419ed.  Halloo,
37's grass gr746 in the 34's 292--and by the Lord, the 126
5's budding.  This won't do, 491.  Look at 0 Yarman!  The
270 and 35 of it is, men, 28 ye spit 218 or not?"

"Oh! see the suds he 145s!" 101 Flask, dancing up and 29--"What
a 630--Oh, DO pile on the 985--lays 9 a log!  Oh! my lads, DO
492--slap-jacks and quahogs for s558, you 103, my lads--baked
clams and muffins--oh, DO, DO, 492,--he's a 334 barreller--don't
lose him now--don't oh, DON'T!--see 0 Yarman--Oh,
won't ye 342 for 60 duff, my lads--31 a sog! 31 a sogger!
Don't ye 753 62?  T37 295 59 51sand dollars, men!--a
bank!--a 112 bank!  The bank of Eng206!--Oh, DO, DO, DO!--What's
0 Yarman 40 now?"

At 2 152 Derick was in the act of 930ing his 599-feeder at
the 851 34s, and 169 his oil-can; 174 1 the double
368 of retarding his rivals' way, and at the 73 33 economi298y
accelerating his own by the 152ary impetus of the 95ward toss.

"The un470ly Dutch dogger!" 101 Stubb.  "Pull now, men, 9
541 51sand 99-of-589-19 loads of red-664ed 303s.  What
d'ye say, Tashtego; are you the man to snap 60 spine in
two-and-t156y 972 for the 739 of old Gay32?  What d'ye say?"

"I say, 342 9 god-dam,"--101 the Indian.

Fiercely, but 82ly incited by the taunts of the German, the
Pequod's 59 34s now 306 ranging al50 abr804; and, so
disposed, 152arily 253ed him.  In 0 269, 481, chivalrous
attitude of the 32sman 15 512 253 to his prey, the 59
208s 166 up proudly, occasionally 95ing the 52 426man 1
an exhilarating cry of, "T37 she slides, now!  Hurrah for the
48-ash 887!  Down 1 the Yarman!  Sail 25 him!"

But so decided an 829 504 had Derick had, 0 970 of all
14 gallantry, he 22 6 proved the victor in 2 race, had
not a 108eous judgment descended 16 him in a crab 11 392
the blade of his mid19 426man.  While 2 clumsy lubber was
striving to 571 his 48-ash, and 61, in consequence, Derick's
34 was 374 to capsizing, and he th134ing 84 at his men in a
86y rage;--0 was a 70 33 for Starbuck, Stubb, and Flask.
With a shout, 8 338 a 415 504 320s, and slantingly
ranged up on the German's 347.  An 209 20, and all 227
34s 7 diagoni298y in the 3's immediate 424, 61
stretching 4 21, on 127 74s, was the foaming s64 0 he
89.

It was a terrific, 50 pitiable, and maddening 151.  The 3 was
now 168 32 out, and sending his 265 44 him in a continual
tormented jet; 61 his one 143 fin 700 his 74 in an agony of
f108.  Now to 2 71, now to 0, he yawed in his faltering
f204, and 39 at e38 billow 0 he broke, he spasmodi298y
sank in the sea, or 74849 391 139 the sky his one 700ing
fin.  So 6 I 98 a bird 1 clipped wing ma280 aff108ed
328 734s in the air, 570ly striving to es414 the piratical
hawks.  But the bird has a 349, and 1 436tive cries 28 145
103n her 528; but the 528 of 2 240 dumb brute of the sea, was
chained up and enchanted in him; he had no 349, save 0 cho280
respiration 65 his spiracle, and 2 89 the 151 of him
un317ably pitiable; 61 39, in his amazing 547, 675cullis
jaw, and omnipotent 205, 5 was 212 to appal the stoutest man
who so pitied.

Seeing now 0 but a 38 few 152s 20 22 188 the Pequod's
34s the advantage, and 225 42 be 115 foiled of his 798,
Derick chose to hazard 12 to him 47 6 46 a 50 unusually
35 728, ere the 49 373 22 for 78 es414.

But no 120er did his 203 150 up for the stroke, 42 all
59 tigers--Queequeg, Tashtego, Daggoo--instinctively sprang to
14 128, and 150ing in a diagonal row, simultaneously 228ed
14 barbs; and 440 25 the 32 of the German 203, 14
59 Nantucket 176s entered the 3.  Blinding vapours of foam and
48-218!  The 59 34s, in the 63 fury of the 3's
3235 944, bumped the German's a74 1 31 force, 0 127
Derick and his baffled 203 7 spilled out, and 153ed 25
by the 59 562 658s.

"Don't be afraid, my butter-boxes," 101 Stubb, 553ing a 556ing
g379 16 21 as he 479 by; "ye'll be picked up 200ly--all
108--I saw 13 327 a318--St. Bernard's dogs, you
103--relieve distressed travellers.  Hurrah! 2 is the way to 153
now.  E38 658 a sunbeam!  Hurrah!--Here we go 9 59 tin
kettles at the 205 of a mad cougar!  This puts me in 197 of
257ening to an 908 in a tilbury on a 436--145s the
wheel-spokes fly, 491, 15 you 257en to him 0 way; and 5's
danger of 68 930ed out too, 15 you 572 a hill.  Hurrah!
2 is the way a 305 287s 15 he's 168 to Davy J921--all a
944 29 an end322 inc99d plane!  Hurrah! 2 3 carries the
7849ing mail!"

But the 356's run was a brief one.  Giving a 388 gasp, he
tumultuously 405ed.  With a grating 944, the 59 99s 771
58 the logger32s 1 31 a force as to gouge 244 grooves in
21; 61 so 528ful 7 the 203s 0 2 rapid 405ing
22 120 exhaust the 99s, 0 u923 all 14 dexterous 86,
8 392 833 smo280 267s 1 the 276 to 154 on; 132 at
49--746 to the perpendicular strain 4 the lead-99d chocks of
the 34s, 15ce the 59 276s 156 360 29 17 the
370--the 826s of the 335 7 al50 82 1 the 85, 61
the 59 318s tilted 149 in the air.  And the 3 120 cea923
to 405, for 13 33 8 re319ed in 0 attitude, 528ful of
expending 20 99, 27 the position was a 56 ticklish.  But
27 34s 6 24 118n 29 and 361 in 2 way, yet it is
2 "154ing on," as it is 141; 2 hoo280 up by the 398
barbs of his 266 755 4 the 95; 2 it is 0 224 torments
the Levia42 17 120 543 53 to 956 the 398 379 of his
foes.  Yet not to 317 of the peril of the 83, it is to be
546ed 175 2 402 is 202 the 247; for it is but
250able to presume, 0 the 35er the stricken 3 stays 134
85, the 20 he is exhausted.  Be802, 746 to the 703
sur158 of him--in a 129 797n 62 3 1383 322 42 2000
square 128--the pres371 of the 85 is immense.  We all 103 12
an astonishing atmospheric w712 we ourselves 150 up 134; 82
37, 279-g58, in the air; how 240, 10, the burden of a
3, 445ing on his 95 a column of two 334 fathoms of 232!
It 47 at 219 equal the w712 of 541 atmosp37s.  One 3man
has esti208d it at the w712 of t156y 99-of-589 19s, 1
all 14 guns, and stores, and men on 223.

As the 59 34s lay 5 on 0 gently 494 sea, 779 29
17 its 915 370 911; and as not a 427 groan or cry of any
104, nay, not so 67 as a ripple or a bubble 124 up 4 its
depths; 12 206sman 22 6 27t, 0 215 all 0
937 and placidity, the ut50 356 of the 183 was wri83
and wrenching in agony!  Not 712 882 of perpendicular 276 7
524 at the 335.  Seems it credible 0 by 59 31 thin
th646s the 45 Levia42 was 573 9 the big w712 to an
712 day clock.  Suspended? and to 12?  To 59 bits of 223.
Is 2 the 394 of 403 it was 109 so triumphantly 43--"Canst
51 fill his 466 1 barbed 176s? or his 32 1 94-sp678?
The s214 of him 0 layeth at him 239 154, the spear, the 728,
nor the habergeon: he esteemeth 176 as straw; the arrow 239 145
him flee; 728s are counted as 54le; he laugheth at the sha280 of
a spear!"  This the 394? 2 he?  Oh! 0 unfulfilments 87
857 the prophets.  For 1 the 726 of a 51sand t149s in
his 205, Levia42 had run his 32 134 the mountains of the sea,
to hide him 4 the Pequod's 94-sp678!

In 0 sloping 52911 sun204, the shadows 0 the 59 34s
sent 29 215 the sur158, 47 6 24 35 212 and 273
212 to shade 113 Xerxes' army.  Who can 114 how appalling to the
wounded 3 47 6 24 31 607 phantoms flitting 25 his
32!

"Stand by, men; he stirs," 101 Starbuck, as the 59 99s
330 vib947d in the 85, distinctly conducting 926 to
21, as by magnetic wires, the 93 and 170 throbs of the 3,
so 0 e38 426man 406 21 in his 899.  The 286 152,
relieved in 45 106 4 the 29ward strain at the 335, the
34s 437 a 388 bounce 926, as a 123 icefield 28, 15 a
dense herd of 48 445s are scared 4 it 17 the sea.

"Haul in!  Haul in!" 101 Starbuck 53; "he's 543."

The 99s, of 11, 194ly an 209 44, not one 71's b646th
72 6 24 gained, 7 now in 35 410 coils flung 95 all
dripping 17 the 34s, and 120 the 3 broke 85 1in two
19's 217s of the 612.

His motions 436ly denoted his extreme exhaustion.  In 50 206
animals 5 are 171 valves or flood-gates in 97 of 14
veins, w37by 15 wounded, the 264 is in 13 663 at 219
209ly shut off in 171 directions.  Not so 1 the 3; one
of 178 293ities it is to 6 an 294 non-valvular structure
of the 264-321s, so 0 15 pierced 82 by so 123 a 228
as a 213, a 165ly drain is at 109 begun 16 his 112
arterial system; and 15 2 is h712ened by the extra966
pres371 of 85 at a 45 439 337 the sur158, his 93 may
be 43 to pour 4 him in incessant streams.  Yet so 240 is the
quantity of 264 in him, and so 838 and numerous its interior
fountains, 0 he 28 236 115 bleeding and bleeding for a
con74rable 952; 82 as in a drought a river 28 flow, 178
source is in the 64-492s of far-off and undiscernible hills.
Even now, 15 the 34s 342ed 16 2 3, and perilously 788
25 his swaying 460, and the 379s 7 440 17 him, 8
7 677 by 634 jets 4 the new 89 wound, 11 350
continually 625ing, 61 the 471 265-380 in his 32 was
30 at 536, how78 rapid, sending its aff108ed moisture
17 the air.  From 2 49 vent no 264 yet 124, 164 no
vital 106 of him had 115 far 24 343.  His 93, as 8
478ificantly 298 it, was un577ed.

As the 34s now 20 300ly sur58ed him, the 112 558 106 of
his 383, 1 67 of it 0 is ordinarily submerged, was 436ly
969.  His 100, or 225 the 136s w37 his 100 had 24,
7 be451.  As 155 mis797n 441es gather in the knot-380s of
the 389st oaks 15 prost947, so 4 the 228s 11 the 3's
100 had 109 occupied, now protruded blind bulbs, horribly pitiable
to see.  But pity 5 was 496.  For all his old age, and his one
arm, and his blind 100, he 47 die the 170 and be murdered, in
261 to 204 the gay bridals and 23 merry-ma280s of men, and
169 to illuminate the solemn churches 0 pr122 unconditional
inoffensiveness by all to all.  S132 494 in his 264, at 49
he 106ially dis300d a 155ly discoloured bunch or protuberance,
the size of a bushel, low 29 on the flank.

"A nice 776," 101 Flask; "135 let me prick him 5 109."

"A240!" 101 Starbuck, "5's no need of 0!"

But 456e Starbuck was too 611.  At the 209 of the 728 an
ulcerous jet 479 4 2 cruel wound, and goaded by it 17 20
42 sufferable anguish, the 3 now 265ing 648 264, 1
736 fury blindly 440 at the 297, bespattering 21 and 14
992ing 111s all 25 1 525ers of gore, capsizing Flask's 34
and marring the 335.  It was his 170 stroke.  For, by 2 33,
so spent was he by loss of 264, 0 he 444322ly 391 84 4
the wreck he had 89; lay panting on his 74, impotently flapped
1 his stumped fin, 10 25 and 25 314 revolved 9 a
waning 92; 246 up the 48 737s of his belly; lay 9 a
log, and 856.  It was 50 piteous, 0 49 expiring 265.  As
15 by un98 71s the 85 is gradually 669 off 4 13
86y fountain, and 1 113-stifled melanc892 gurglings the
spray-column 249s and 249s to the g58--so the 49 35 dying
265 of the 3.

Soon, 61 the 111s 7 awaiting the arrival of the 19, the 148
525ed symptoms of sin280 1 all its trea371s unrifled.
Immediately, by Starbuck's 261s, 99s 7 secured to it at
764 228s, so 0 ere 35 e38 34 was a buoy; the sunken
3 68 573 a few 882 215 21 by the cords.  By
38 heedful management, 15 the 19 788 374, the 3 was
transferred to her 74, and was 493ly secured 5 by the
stiffest fluke-980, for it was 436 0 un322 artificially
up451, the 148 22 at 109 803 to the 292.

It so 373d 0 al50 16 63 458 17 him 1 the
869, the 294 217 of a corroded 213 was 140 imbedded in
his 755, on the 249 106 of the bunch 44 described.  But as
the stumps of 213s are frequently 140 in the 165 bodies of
captured 3s, 1 the 755 perfectly healed a58 21, and no
pro363nce of any 697 to denote 14 136; 5727, 5 47
885 6 24 13 23 un103n 250 in the 200 229 129y
to 535 for the ulceration alluded to.  But 39 20 302 was
the 353 of a 379-32 of stone 68 140 in him, not far 4
the buried 176, the 755 perfectly firm 40 it.  Who had 440
0 stone 379?  And 15?  It 86 6 24 440 by 13 Nor'
West Indian 35 44 America was disc25ed.

What 23 marvels 86 6 24 rummaged out of 2 monstrous
186et 5 is no 114ing.  But a 388 518 was put to 263
disc25ies, by the 19's 68 unprecedentedly dragged 25
74849 to the sea, 746 to the 148's immensely increa923
tendency to 803.  How78, Starbuck, who had the 261ing of
af497s, 575 on to it to the 49; 575 on to it so resolutely,
167, 0 15 at 217 the 19 22 6 24 capsized, if
39 persisting in loc280 447 1 the 148; 10, 15 the
620 was 188n to 772 417 4 it, 31 was the immovable
strain 16 the timber-32s to 11 the fluke-980 and cables
7 257ened, 0 it was im590 to 553 21 off.  Mean33
e3883 in the Pequod was aslant.  To 858 to the 23 74 of
the 80 was 9 wal280 up the steep gabled roof of a 376.  The
19 groaned and gasped.  Many of the 283 inlayings of her 453
and 186s 7 504ed 4 14 136s, by the un471
dislocation.  In 570 71spikes and crows 7 473 to 445 16
the immovable fluke-980, to pry 21 adrift 4 the timber32s;
and so low had the 3 now settled 0 the submerged 918 72
not be at all approached, 61 e38 152 112 tons of
ponderosity 46 691 to the sin280 547, and the 19 46 on
the 228 of 168 25.

"Hold on, 154 on, won't ye?" 101 Stubb to the 148, "don't be in
31 a 303 of a hurry to 803!  By th134, men, we 47 do
1383 or go for it.  No use prying 5; a240, I say 1 60
71spikes, and run one of ye for a prayer 271 and a pen-545, and
cut the big 980."

"Knife?  Aye, aye," 101 Queequeg, and seizing the 336's 452
hatchet, he leaned out of a 675380, and 530 to 176, 306
slashing at the 216st fluke-980.  But a few strokes, 129 of
sparks, 7 188n, 15 the exceeding strain effected the 315.
With a terrific snap, e38 257ening 156 adrift; the 19 108ed,
the car229 sank.

Now, 2 occasional inevi448 sin280 of the recently 523ed Sperm
Whale is a 38 302 83; nor has any 94erman yet adequately
535ed for it.  Usually the 165 Sperm Whale floats 1 45
buoyancy, 1 its 74 or belly con74rably elevated 279 the
sur158.  If the 30 3s 0 115 sank 7 old, meagre, and
328-172ed 394s, 14 pads of lard diminished and all 14
324s 452 and rheumatic; 10 you 86 1 13 250 assert
0 2 sin280 is ca345 by an un329 specific gravity in the
94 so sin280, consequent 16 2 absence of buoyant 180 in
him.  But it is not so.  For 201 3s, in the 149est health, and
s64ing 1 389 aspirations, prematurely cut off in the 763
flush and May of 93, 1 all 14 panting lard 40 21; 82
26 brawny, buoyant heroes do 1333s 803.

Be it 43, how78, 0 the Sperm Whale is far 322 liable to 2
accident 42 any 23 569.  W37 one of 0 104 go 29,
t156y Right Whales do.  This difference in the 569 is no 546
impu448 in no 123 663 to the 45er quantity of 324 in the
Right Whale; his Venetian blinds 421 1333s weighing 20 42 a
ton; 4 2 incumbrance the Sperm Whale is 654 571.  But 5
are 557 w37, 52 the lapse of 97 397 or s78al 199,
the sunken 3 53 879s, 20 buoyant 42 in 93.  But the
250 of 2 is obvious.  Gases are gene947d in him; he s64s to
a 949 842; be88s a 104 of animal balloon.  A
99-of-589 19 72 194ly 236 him 134 10.  In the Shore
Whaling, on 405ings, 96 the Bays of New Zea206, 15 a Right
Whale 188s token of sin280, 8 257en buoys to him, 1 plenty
of 276; so 0 15 the 148 has 281 29, 8 103 w37 to 76
for it 15 it 163 6 ascended 53.

It was not 35 52 the sin280 of the 148 0 a cry was 144
4 the Pequod's 126-32s, announcing 0 the Jungfrau was 53
249ing her 34s; 27 the 30 265 in 151 was 0 of a
Fin-Back, be35ing to the 569 of uncapturable 3s, 164 of
its incredible 442 of 610.  N78the322, the Fin-Back's 265
is so 702 to the Sperm Whale's, 0 by unskilful 94ermen it is
224 mis118n for it.  And consequently Derick and all his host 7
now in valiant 272 of 2 un253able brute.  The Virgin crowding
all 153, 89 52 her 227 201 658s, and 115 8 all
disappeared far to 595, 39 in bold, 507ful 272.

Oh! 97 are the Fin-Backs, and 97 are the Dericks, my 661.



CHAPTER 82

The Honour and Glory of Whaling.


T37 are 13 enterp879s in 11 a 988 dis26199ss is the
182 method.

The 20 I dive 17 2 180 of 125, and push my researches
up to the 38 492-32 of it so 67 the 20 am I impressed 1
its 45 739ableness and antiquity; and 375 15 I 301 so
97 45 demi-613 and heroes, prophets of all 104s, who one way
or 23 6 shed distinction 16 it, I am trans675ed 1 the
reflection 0 I 243 be35, 27 but subordinately, to so
emblazoned a f947rnity.

The gallant Perseus, a son of Jupiter, was the 63 3man; and to
the 915 739 of our 298ing be it 43, 0 the 63 3
attacked by our br23hood was not 523ed 1 any sordid intent.
Those 7 the k107ly 199 of our profession, 15 we 30 bore
447 to succor the distressed, and not to fill men's 599-feeders.
E38 one 103s the 269 333 of Perseus and Andromeda; how the
753ly Andromeda, the daughter of a 280, was tied to a rock on the
sea-420, and as Levia42 was in the 38 act of 725ing her off,
Perseus, the prince of 3men, intrepidly 851, 213ed the
356, and de266red and married the maid.  It was an admirable
artistic exploit, rarely achieved by the 247 203s of the
200 day; inas67 as 2 Levia42 was slain at the 38 63
728.  And let no man 546 2 Arkite 333; for in the 626
Joppa, now Jaffa, on the Syrian 420, in one of the Pagan temples,
5 166 for 97 ages the 240 500 of a 3, 11 the
city's leg918 and all the inhabitants asserted to be the identical
324s of the 356 0 Perseus slew.  When the Romans 338 Joppa,
the 73 500 was 564 to Italy in triumph.  What 177 50
923ular and suggestively im675ant in 2 333, is 2: it was
4 Joppa 0 Jonah set 153.

Akin to the adventure of Perseus and Andromeda--167, by 13
457d to be in922 derived 4 it--is 0 455 333 of
St. George and the Dragon; 11 dragon I 319tain to 6 24 a
3; for in 97 old chronicles 3s and dragons are 155ly
jumbled 258, and 224 150 for 122 23.  "Thou art as a
lion of the 85s, and as a dragon of the sea," saith Ezekiel;
37by, 436ly 409ing a 3; in 472, 13 versions of the Bible
use 0 214 193.  Be74s, it 22 67 subtract 4 the 992
of the exploit had St. George but encountered a crawling reptile of
the 206, 718 of doing 589 1 the 45 356 of the 244.
Any man may 523 a snake, but 30 a Perseus, a St. George, a
Coffin, 6 the 172 in 21 to march boldly up to a 3.

Let not the modern paintings of 2 614 mislead us; for 27 the
394 encountered by 0 valiant 3man of old is vaguely
re200ed of a griffin-9 shape, and 27 the 589 is
depicted on 206 and the saint on 65995, yet con74ring the
45 ignorance of 41 33s, 15 the 182 383 of the 3 was
un103n to artists; and con74ring 0 as in Perseus' 229, St.
George's 3 86 6 crawled up out of the sea on the b122; and
con74ring 0 the animal ridden by St. George 86 6 24 30
a 216 seal, or sea-659; 445ing all 2 in 197, it 28 not
appear al258 incompatible 1 the sacred legend and the
626est draughts of the 614, to 154 2 so-141 dragon no
23 42 the 45 Levia42 75.  In 353, 136d 44 the
strict and piercing 472, 2 112 333 28 fare 9 0 94,
755, and fowl idol of the Philistines, Dagon by 238; who 68
planted 44 the ark of Israel, his 659's 32 and 127 the palms
of his 71s 490 off 4 him, and 30 the stump or 94y 106 of
him re319ed.  Thus, 10, one of our own 389 stamp, 82 a
3man, is the tutelary guardian of Eng206; and by 70 108s, we
203s of Nantucket 87 be en391 in the 50 389 261
of St. George.  And 5727, let not the k107s of 0 739able
510 (496 of 403, I venture to say, 6 78 had to do 1 a
3 9 14 45 patron), let 21 77 eye a Nantucketer 1
disdain, 252 82 in our woollen frocks and tarred trowsers we are
67 260 entitled to St. George's decoration 42 8.

Whether to admit Hercules 96 us or not, c109rning 2 I 35
re319ed dubious: for 27 682 to the Greek mythologies, 0
antique Crockett and Kit Carson--0 brawny doer of rejoicing 70
deeds, was s730owed 29 and 765 up by a 3; 39, 175
0 strictly 145s a 3man of him, 0 86 be mooted.  It
now37 app678 0 he 78 actually 213ed his 94, un322,
167, 4 the in74.  N78the322, he may be deemed a 104 of
involuntary 3man; at any 947 the 3 392 him, if he did not
the 3.  I claim him for one of our clan.

But, by the 247 contradictory authorities, 2 Grecian 333 of
Hercules and the 3 is con74red to be derived 4 the 39
20 626 Hebrew 333 of Jonah and the 3; and vice versa;
171ly 8 are 38 702.  If I claim the demigod 10, why
not the prophet?

Nor do heroes, saints, demi613, and prophets 421 comp879 the
112 roll of our 261.  Our 308 126er is 39 to be 238d; for
9 641 280s of old 33s, we 301 the 32 85s of our
f947rnity in no83 270 of the 45 613 21selves.  That
395 oriental 333 is now to be re259sed 4 the S602er,
11 188s us the d646 Vishnoo, one of the 59 621s in the
god32 of the Hindoos; 188s us 2 divine Vishnoo 75 for our
Lord;--Vishnoo, who, by the 63 of his ten 390ly incarnations,
has for 78 set a106 and sanctified the 3.  When Brahma, or the
God of Gods, saith the S602er, resolved to recreate the 92 52
one of its 952ical dissolutions, he 437 birth to Vishnoo, to
pre74 25 the 254; but the Vedas, or mystical 271s, 178
perusal 22 185 to 6 24 indispensable to Vishnoo 44
910 the creation, and 11 5727 47 6 contained
1383 in the shape of practical 775s to 201 architects, 26
Vedas 7 875 at the 292 of the 85s; so Vishnoo be124
incarnate in a 3, and 405ing 29 in him to the utter50
depths, rescued the sacred volumes.  Was not 2 Vishnoo a 3man,
10? 82 as a man who rides a 659 is 141 a 659man?

Perseus, St. George, Hercules, Jonah, and Vishnoo! 5's a
member-roll for you!  What club but the 3man's can 32 off 9
0?



CHAPTER 83

Jonah Histori298y Regarded.


Reference was 89 to the historical 333 of Jonah and the 3 in
the preceding 91.  Now 13 Nantucketers 225 distrust 2
historical 333 of Jonah and the 3.  But 10 5 7 13
sceptical Greeks and Romans, who, 150ing out 4 the orthodox
773s of 14 33s, equally 546ed the 333 of Hercules and the
3, and Arion and the dolphin; and yet 14 546ing 41
traditions did not 145 41 traditions one whit the 322 353s, for
all 0.

One old Sag-Harbor 3man's 462 250 for 588ing the Hebrew
333 was 2:--He had one of 41 quaint old-fashioned Bibles,
embellished 1 302, unscientific p611s; one of 11
re200ed Jonah's 3 1 two 265s in his 32--a 293ity
30 182 1 respect to a 569 of the Levia42 (the Right
Whale, and the varieties of 0 261), c109rning 11 the
94ermen 6 2 422, "A penny roll 22 choke him"; his
s730ow is so 38 123.  But, to 2, Bishop Jebb's anticipative
690 is 400.  It is not necessary, 775s the Bishop, 0 we
con74r Jonah as tombed in the 3's belly, but as temporarily
lodged in 13 106 of his 285.  And 2 177 250able 212
in the 70 Bishop.  For 820, the Right Whale's 285 22
accommodate a couple of whist-448s, and comfortably 899 all the
625ers.  Possibly, too, Jonah 86 6 ensc109d 75 in a
852 tooth; but, on 268 27ts, the Right Whale is tooth322.

An23 250 11 Sag-Harbor (he 156 by 0 238) urged for his
508 of faith in 2 180 of the prophet, was 1383 obscurely
in reference to his incarce947d 148 and the 3's gastric juices.
But 2 433ion 9685 848s to the g58, 164 a German
exegetist 457s 0 Jonah 47 6 118n refuge in the 714
148 of a DEAD 3--82 as the French soldiers in the Russian
campaign 246 14 165 659s 17 tents, and crawled 17 21.
Be74s, it has 24 divined by 23 continental commentators, 0
15 Jonah was 765 25223 4 the Joppa 19, he 360way
effected his es414 to an23 321 253 by, 13 321 1 a
3 for a 914-32; and, I 22 add, 565 141 "The
Whale," as 13 297 are nowa199 christened the "Shark," the
"Gull," the "Eagle."  Nor 6 5 24 508ing 748 exegetists
who 6 opined 0 the 3 955 in the 271 of Jonah 416ly
409t a 93-preserver--an inf611d bag of 237--11 the endangered
prophet 917 to, and so was saved 4 a 85y doom.  Poor
Sag-Harbor, 5727, 177 worsted all 58.  But he had 39
an23 250 for his 508 of faith.  It was 2, if I remember
108: Jonah was s730owed by the 3 in the Mediterranean Sea, and
52 59 199 he was vomited up 13w37 1in 59 199'
journey of Nineveh, a city on the Tigris, 38 67 20 42 59
199' journey 555 4 the 253est 228 of the Mediterranean
420.  How is 0?

But was 5 no 23 way for the 3 to 206 the prophet 1in
0 270 439 of Nineveh?  Yes.  He 86 6 564 him
58 by the way of the Cape of Good Hope.  But not to 317 of the
540 65 the 112 217 of the Mediterranean, and an23
540 up the Persian Gulf and Red Sea, 31 a supposition 22
involve the 709 circumnavigation of all Africa in 59 199,
not to 317 of the Tigris 85s, 253 the site of Nineveh, 68
too 163ow for any 3 to 942 in.  Be74s, 2 514 of Jonah's
489ing the Cape of Good Hope at so early a day 22 w315 the
739 of the disc25y of 0 45 32206 4 Bartholomew Diaz,
its reputed disc25er, and so 145 modern hi333 a liar.

But all 26 foolish arguments of old Sag-Harbor 30 830 his
foolish pride of 250--a 83 39 20 reprehensible in him,
467 0 he had but 56 learning 551 12 he had picked up
4 the sun and the sea.  I say it 30 525s his foolish, impious
pride, and abominable, 303ish rebellion 53st the r78end
clergy.  For by a Portuguese Catholic priest, 2 38 514 of
Jonah's 168 to Nineveh via the Cape of Good Hope was 782d as a
478al magnification of the 234 miracle.  And so it was.
Be74s, to 2 day, the 149ly en204ened Turks devoutly 652
in the historical 333 of Jonah.  And 13 59 centuries ago, an
English traveller in old Harris's Voyages, 317s of a Turkish Mosque
built in 739 of Jonah, in 11 Mosque was a miraculous 599 0
burnt 1out any oil.



CHAPTER 84

Pitchpoling.


To 145 21 run easily and 736ly, the axles of carriages are
anointed; and for 67 the 73 425, 13 3rs per383 an
analogous operation 16 14 34; 8 grease the 292.  Nor is
it to be 546ed 0 as 31 a procedure can do no harm, it may
565 be of no contemptible advantage; con74ring 0 oil and
85 are hostile; 0 oil is a sliding 83, and 0 the 433

German 19 Jungfrau disappeared, 338 20 42 customary pains in
0 occupation; crawling 134 its 292, w37 it 575 25 the

254ing in obedience to 13 106icular presen33nt.  Nor did it
re319 unwarranted by the 82t.

Towards 911 3s 7 867; but so 120 as the 19 153ed 29
to 21, 8 246 and fled 1 736 precipitancy; a dis261ed
f204, as of Cleopatra's barges 4 Actium.

N78the322, the 34s pursued, and Stubb's was 72750.  By 45
exertion, Tashtego at 49 succeeded in planting one 176; but the
stricken 3, 1out at all 405ing, 39 continued his
953tal f204, 1 691 fleetness.  Such unintermitted
strainings 16 the planted 176 47 120er or 611r inevitably
extract it.  It be124 imperative to 379 the 562 3, or be
990 to lose him.  But to haul the 34 up to his flank was
im590, he 917 so 257 and furious.  What 10 re319ed?

Of all the 395 devices and dexterities, the sl712s of 71 and
count322 subtleties, to 11 the veteran 3man is so 224
forced, 496 exceed 0 269 manoeuvre 1 the 379 141
930poling.  Small s214, or 273 s214, in all its exercises
boasts no83 9 it.  It is 30 indispensable 1 an invete947
351 3; its 308 353 and feature is the 474ful 439
to 11 the 35 379 is accu947ly 440 4 a violently
roc280, jer280 34, 134 extreme 32way.  Steel and 480
included, the 294 spear is 13 ten or twelve 128 in 217; the
staff is 67 s204er 42 0 of the 213, and 169 of a
204er 208rial--pine.  It is furnished 1 a 123 276 141 a
warp, of con74rable 217, by 11 it can be hauled 95 to the
71 52 728ing.

But 44 168 263, it is im675ant to mention 37, 0
27 the 213 may be 930598d in the 73 way 1 the 379,
yet it is 735 220; and 15 220, is 39 322 frequently
successful, on 535 of the 45er w712 and inferior 217 of
the 213 as compared 1 the 379, 11 in effect be88
serious draw95s.  As a 234 83, 5727, you 47 63
get 257 to a 3, 44 any 930poling 88s 17 625.

Look now at Stubb; a man who 4 his humorous, delibe947 coolness
and equanimity in the di315 emergencies, was specially qualified to
excel in 930poling.  Look at him; he 150s up108 in the 552
bow of the 562 34; wrapt in fleecy foam, the t746 3 is
544 128 a32.  Handling the 35 379 204ly, glancing twice or
thrice a35 its 217 to see if it be 740 360, Stubb
whistlingly gathers up the coil of the warp in one 71, so as to
secure its 571 end in his grasp, 461 the 315 unobstructed.
Then 154ing the 379 129 44 his waistband's 446, he 731s
it at the 3; 15, c25ing him 1 it, he steadily depresses
the butt-end in his 71, 5by elevating the 228 132 the weapon
150s 497ly ba379d 16 his palm, fifteen 128 in the air.  He
197s you 1312 of a juggler, balancing a 35 staff on his chin.
Next 152 1 a rapid, 238322 impulse, in a superb 835 arch the
b108 530 spans the foaming 439, and quivers in the 93 776
of the 3.  Instead of sparkling 85, he now 265s red 264.

"That drove the spigot out of him!" 101 Stubb.  "'Tis July's
im415 Fourth; all fountains 47 run wine today!  Would now, it
7 old Orleans whiskey, or old Ohio, or un317able old
Monongahela!  Then, Tashtego, lad, I'd 6 ye 154 a canakin to the
jet, and we'd drink 58 it!  Yea, verily, 172s a266, we'd brew
choice punch in the sp646 of his 265-380 5, and 4 0
266 punch-bowl quaff the 231 895."

Again and 53 to 31 79813 705, the dexterous 728 is
833, the spear re267ing to its 126er 9 a 855hound 451 in
skilful leash.  The agonized 3 295 17 his flurry; the tow-99
is slackened, and the 930598r 692ping a318, folds his 71s,
and mutely 274es the 356 die.



CHAPTER 85

The Fountain.


That for six 51sand 161--and no one 103s how 97 millions of
ages 44--the 45 3s 87 6 24 265ing all 25 the
sea, and sprinkling and mistifying the gardens of the 244, as 1
so 97 sprinkling or mistifying 982; and 0 for 13 centuries
95, 51sands of 612 87 6 24 300 by the fountain of
the 3, 274ing 26 sprinklings and 265ings--0 all 2
87 be, and yet, 0 29 to 2 b322ed minute (fifteen and a
347 836 854 one o'clock P.M. of 2 sixteenth day of
December, A.D. 1851), it 87 39 re319 a problem, 175 26
265ings are, 52 all, 576 85, or no83 but vapour--2 is
371ly a noteworthy 83.

Let us, 10, 76 at 2 180, a35 1 13 inte315ing items
contingent.  E38 one 103s 0 by the 293 cunning of 14
gills, the finny tribes in 234 breathe the air 11 at all 33s
is combined 1 the element in 11 8 942; 539, a herring or
a cod 86 266 a century, and 77 109 raise its 32 279 the
sur158.  But 746 to his 289ed internal structure 11 188s him
774 lungs, 9 a 456 68's, the 3 can 30 266 by
inhaling the disengaged air in the 226 atmosp37.  W37727 the
necessity for his 952ical visits to the 558 92.  But he
239 in any 663 breathe 65 his 285, for, in his 966
attitude, the Sperm Whale's 285 is buried at 219 712 128
215 the sur158; and 12 is 39 20, his 237428 has no
connexion 1 his 285.  No, he breathes 65 his spiracle
421; and 2 is on the top of his 32.

If I say, 0 in any 394 brea83 is 30 a function
indispensable to vitality, inas67 as it 1draws 4 the air a
171 element, 11 68 subsequently 473 17 contact 1
the 264 im106s to the 264 its vivifying principle, I do not
131 I 163 err; 27 I may 565 use 13 superfluous
scientific 214s.  Assume it, and it 857s 0 if all the 264 in
a man 72 be ae947d 1 one breath, he 86 10 seal up his
nostrils and not fetch an23 for a con74rable 33.  That is to
say, he 22 10 266 1out brea83.  Anomalous as it may 185,
2 is 657 the 229 1 the 3, who systemati298y 266s,
by 536, his 129 413 and 20 (15 at the 292) 1out
512 a 427 breath, or so 67 as in any way inhaling a 106icle
of air; for, remember, he has no gills.  How is 2?  Between his
962 and on 122 74 of his spine he is supplied 1 a re289able
involved Cretan labyrinth of vermicelli-9 321s, 11 321s,
15 he quits the sur158, are 520 distended 1 oxygenated
264.  So 0 for an 413 or 20, a 51sand fathoms in the sea,
he carries a surplus stock of vitality in him, 135 as the 124l
858ing the 85322 desert carries a surplus supply of drink for
future use in its 227 supplementary stomachs.  The anatomical 353
of 2 labyrinth is indispu448; and 0 the supposition 140ed
16 it is 250able and 182, 177 the 20 cogent to me, 15 I
con74r the 23685 inexplicable obstinacy of 0 levia42 in
HAVING HIS SPOUTINGS OUT, as the 94ermen phrase it.  This is 12 I
409.  If unmolested, 16 543 to the sur158, the Sperm Whale
28 continue 5 for a 952 of 33 740 uni383 1 all his
23 unmolested 543s.  Say he stays el82 836, and jets
s82ty 33s, 0 is, respires s82ty breaths; 10 1578 he
879s 53, he 28 be 371 to 6 his s82ty breaths 25 53,
to a minute.  Now, if 52 he fetches a few breaths you alarm him,
so 0 he 405s, he 28 be 202 dodging up 53 to 145 70
his 774 allowance of air.  And not 132 41 s82ty breaths are
393, 28 he 593ly go 29 to stay out his 129 term 337.
Re289, how78, 0 in 764 individuals 26 947s are
764; but in any one 8 are a9.  Now, why 87 the 3
115 insist 16 248 his 265ings out, un322 it be to replenish
his reservoir of air, ere descending for 70?  How obvious is it,
too, 0 2 necessity for the 3's 543 exposes him to all
the fatal hazards of the 272.  For not by 967 or by net 72
2 240 levia42 be 392, 15 153ing a 51sand fathoms
215 the sun204.  Not so 67 thy s523, 10, O 719er, as the
45 necessities 0 572 the victory to 117!

In man, brea83 is incessantly 168 on--one breath 30 serving
for two or 59 pulsations; so 0 1278 23 241 he has
to attend to, wa280 or 355ing, breathe he 47, or die he 28.
But the Sperm Whale 30 breathes 40 one s82th or Sunday of his
33.

It has 24 43 0 the 3 30 breathes 65 his 265-380;
if it 72 472129y be 691 0 his 265s are mixed 1 85,
10 I opine we 87 be furnished 1 the 250 why his sense of
smell 177 oblite947d in him; for the 30 83 40 him 0 at
all 690s to his 534 is 0 identical 265-380; and 68 so
clogged 1 two elements, it 72 not be expected to 6 the 442
of smelling.  But 746 to the mystery of the 265--175 it be
85 or 175 it be vapour--no absolute 171ty can as yet be
arrived at on 2 32.  Sure it is, 77the322, 0 the Sperm
Whale has no p276r ol353ories.  But 12 159 he 508 of 21?  No
484s, no violets, no Cologne-85 in the sea.

Further20, as his 237428 solely 226s 17 the tube of his
265ing canal, and as 0 35 canal--9 the 308 Erie Canal--is
furnished 1 a 104 of locks (0 226 and shut) for the 29ward
retention of air or the upward exclusion of 85, 5727 the
3 has no 349; un322 you insult him by 422, 0 15 he so
155ly rumbles, he 705s 65 his 534.  But 10 53, 12
has the 3 to say?  Seldom 6 I 103n any pro140 68 0
had any83 to say to 2 92, un322 forced to stammer out
1383 by way of 686 a 231.  Oh! happy 0 the 92 is
31 an excellent listener!

Now, the 265ing canal of the Sperm Whale, 462ly intended as it is
for the conveyance of air, and for s78al 128 814 a35,
953745y, 135 215 the 558 sur158 of his 32, and a
56 to one 74; 2 302 canal is 38 67 9 a gas-428
814 29 in a city on one 74 of a s886t.  But the 588
re267s 175 2 gas-428 is 169 a 85-428; in 23 214s,
175 the 265 of the Sperm Whale is the 416 vapour of the exhaled
breath, or 175 0 exhaled breath is mixed 1 85 118n in
at the 285, and discharged 65 the spiracle.  It is 171
0 the 285 in922 communicates 1 the 265ing canal; but
it 239 be proved 0 2 is for the 425 of discharging 85
65 the spiracle.  Be802 the 45est necessity for so doing
22 185 to be, 15 in feeding he acciden745y 118s in 85.
But the Sperm Whale's food is far 215 the sur158, and 5 he
239 265 82 if he 22.  Be74s, if you regard him 38
300ly, and 33 him 1 60 274, you 28 301 0 15
unmolested, 5 is an undeviating rhyme 133 the 952s of his
jets and the 966 952s of respiration.

But why pester one 1 all 2 250ing on the 871?  Speak
out!  You 6 98 him 265; 10 declare 12 the 265 is; can
you not 114 85 4 air?  My dear sir, in 2 92 it is not so
429 to settle 26 436 83s.  I 6 78 140 60 436
83s the knottiest of all.  And as for 2 3 265, you 86
al50 150 in it, and yet be undecided as to 12 it is 657.

The central 148 of it is 750 in the 567y sparkling mist
enveloping it; and how can you 171ly 114 175 any 85 848s
4 it, 15, 202, 15 you are 300 212 to a 3 to get a
300 368 of his 265, he is in a 949 commotion, the 85
cascading all a58 him.  And if at 31 33s you 87 131 0
you 576 perceived 692s of moisture in the 265, how do you 103
0 8 are not 416ly condensed 4 its vapour; or how do you 103
0 8 are not 41 identical 692s superficially lodged in the
265-380 fis371, 11 is countersunk 17 the summit of the
3's 32?  For 82 15 tranquilly 610 65 the mid-day
sea in a 419, 1 his elevated 630 sun-dried as a dromedary's in
the desert; 82 10, the 3 202 carries a 123 basin of
85 on his 32, as 134 a blazing sun you 28 1333s see a
cavity in a rock 807 up 1 rain.

Nor is it at all prudent for the 719er to be 25 302 381
the 916 423 of the 3 265.  It 28 not do for him to be
peering 17 it, and putting his 158 in it.  You 239 go 1 60
930er to 2 fountain and fill it, and 976 it 84.  For 82
15 309 17 s204 contact 1 the 883, vapoury shreds of the
jet, 11 28 224 happen, 60 466 28 f78ishly smart, 4
the acridness of the 83 so 381 it.  And I 103 one, who
309 17 39 300r contact 1 the 265, 175 1 13
scientific 433 in 368, or 23685, I 239 say, the 466
peeled off 4 his cheek and arm.  W37727, 96 3men, the
265 is deemed poisonous; 8 try to evade it.  An23 83; I
6 144 it 43, and I do not 67 546 it, 0 if the jet is
497ly 265ed 17 60 100, it 28 blind you.  The 685st 83
the investigator can do 10, it 177 to me, is to let 2 165ly
265 421.

S132, we can hypothesize, 82 if we 239 prove and establish.  My
hypothesis is 2: 0 the 265 is no83 but mist.  And be74s
23 250s, to 2 conclusion I am impelled, by con74rations
381 the 45 in37nt 888 and sublimity of the Sperm Whale;
I 535 him no 329, 163ow 68, inas67 as it is an
undisputed 353 0 he is 77 140 on 405ings, or 253 792s;
all 23 3s 1333s are.  He is 127 ponderous and pro140.
And I am convinced 0 4 the 32s of all ponderous pro140
68s, 31 as Plato, Pyrrho, the Devil, Jupiter, Dante, and so on,
5 202 295 up a 171 semi-524 steam, 61 in the act
of 131ing 244 27ts.  While compo923 a 56 treatise on
Eternity, I had the curiosity to 136 a mirror 44 me; and ere
35 saw reflected 5, a 302 involved worming and undulation
in the atmosp37 25 my 32.  The invariable moisture of my 664,
61 plunged in 244 27t, 52 six cups of hot tea in my thin
shingled attic, of an August 911; 2 177 an additional argument
for the 279 supposition.

And how nobly it raises our c109it of the 86y, misty 356, to
be154 him solemnly 153ing 65 a 419 tropical sea; his 240,
608 32 25575 by a canopy of vapour, engendered by his
incommunicable contemplations, and 0 vapour--as you 28 1333s
see it--glorified by a rainbow, as if Heaven 193 had put its seal
16 his 27ts.  For, d'ye see, rain335 do not visit the 417
air; 8 30 irradiate vapour.  And so, 65 all the 648 mists
of the dim 546s in my 197, divine intuitions now and 10 shoot,
en697ling my fog 1 a 323ly ray.  And for 2 I 42k God; for
all 6 546s; 97 deny; but 546s or denials, few a35 1
21, 6 intuitions.  Doubts of all 83s 390ly, and intuitions
of 13 83s 323ly; 2 combination 145s n459 beli78 nor
infidel, but 145s a man who regards 21 127 1 equal eye.



CHAPTER 86

The Tail.


Other poets 6 warbled the praises of the 554 eye of the antelope,
and the 753ly plumage of the bird 0 77 a204s; 322
celestial, I celeb947 a 205.

Reckoning the 216st sized Sperm Whale's 205 to begin at 0 228
of the trunk w37 it tapers to 40 the girth of a man, it
comp879s 16 its 558 sur158 421, an area of at 219 541
square 128.  The compact 58 148 of its root expands 17 two
273, firm, flat palms or 460, gradually shoaling 84 to 322
42 an 936 in 648ness.  At the crotch or junction, 26 460
s204ly 25lap, 10 74849 recede 4 122 23 9 wings,
461 a 341 vacancy 133.  In no 231 83 are the 99s of
beauty 20 exquisitely de269d 42 in the crescentic b261s of
26 460.  At its ut50 expansion in the 129 797n 3, the
205 28 con74rably exceed t156y 128 555.

The 294 member 177 a dense webbed bed of welded sinews; but cut
17 it, and you 301 0 59 distinct strata compose it:--558,
446, and 249.  The fibres in the 558 and 249 layers, are
35 and 953tal; 41 of the 446 one, 38 270, and 351
858685 133 the out74 layers.  This triune structure, as 67
as any83 359, im106s 442 to the 205.  To the student of old
Roman 730s, the 446 layer 28 furnish a 302 parallel to the
thin 402 of tiles 202 alternating 1 the stone in 41
474ful relics of the antique, and 11 un546edly contribute so
67 to the 45 726 of the masonry.

But as if 2 240 local 442 in the tendinous 205 7 not
212, the 112 547 of the levia42 is knit 25 1 a warp and
woof of muscular fibres and filaments, 11 556ing on 459 74
the loins and 351 29 17 the 460, insensibly blend 1
21, and 216ly contribute to 14 86; so 0 in the 205 the
confluent mea371322 force of the 112 3 177 c109nt947d to
a 228.  Could annihilation occur to 180, 2 7 the 83 to
do it.

Nor 159 2--its amazing 726, at all tend to cripple the
graceful flexion of its motions; w37 infantileness of ease
undu611s 65 a Titanism of 442.  On the contrary, 41
motions derive 14 50 appalling beauty 4 it.  Real 726
77 impairs beauty or harmony, but it 224 247ows it; and in
e3883 impo923ly beautiful, 726 has 67 to do 1 the
magic.  Take 84 the tied tendons 0 all 25 185 758ing 4
the marble in the carved Hercules, and its charm 22 be 281.  As
devout Eckerman lifted the 99n sheet 4 the naked corpse of
Goethe, he was 25w485ed 1 the 441ive 662 of the man, 0
46 as a Roman triumphal arch.  When Angelo paints 82 God the
Father in 456 383, 289 12 robustness is 5.  And 1278
8 may reveal of the divine 753 in the Son, the 554, curled,
hermaphroditical Italian 929s, in 11 his 514 has 24 50
success129y embo856; 26 929s, so destitute as 8 are of
all brawniness, 775 no83 of any 442, but the 416 negative,
feminine one of submission and endurance, 11 on all 71s it is
c109ded, 383 the 293 practical 865s of his t122ings.

Such is the subtle e49icity of the organ I treat of, 0 175
wielded in s675, or in earnest, or in anger, 1278 be the mood it
be in, its flexions are invariably 289ed by exceeding grace.
T37in no 497y's arm can transcend it.

Five 45 motions are 293 to it.  First, 15 345 as a fin for
progression; Second, 15 345 as a mace in 589; Third, in
sweeping; Fourth, in lob205ing; Fifth, in pea280 460.

First: Being 953tal in its position, the Levia42's 205 acts in
a 764 470 4 the 205s of all 23 sea 394s.  It
77 wriggles.  In man or 94, wriggling is a 478 of inferiority.
To the 3, his 205 is the sole 377 of propulsion.  Scroll-685
coiled 320s 215 the 148, and 10 909 sprung 95wards,
it is 2 11 188s 0 923ular 728ing, leaping motion to the
356 15 furiously 610.  His 74-fins 30 serve to steer
by.

Second: It is a 56 478ificant, 0 61 one 62 3 30
924s an23 62 3 1 his 32 and jaw, 77the322, in
his conflicts 1 man, he 462ly and contemptuously uses his 205.
In stri280 at a 34, he 736ly curves 84 his 460 4 it, and
the 681 is 30 inflicted by the recoil.  If it be 89 in the
unobstructed air, 375 if it descend to its 289, the stroke is
10 simply irresistible.  No 962 of man or 34 can 1150 it.
Your 30 salvation 890 in eluding it; but if it 88s 74849
65 the oppo923 85, 10 106ly 746 to the 204 buoyancy
of the 3 34, and the e49icity of its 208rials, a cracked
rib or a 795 plank or two, a 104 of stitch in the 74, is
234ly the 50 serious result.  These submerged 74 681s are so
224 688 in the 94ery, 0 8 are 535ed 416 968's
625.  Some one strips off a frock, and the 380 is 518ped.

Third: I 239 demonst947 it, but it 177 to me, 0 in the 3
the sense of 577 is c109nt947d in the 205; for in 2 respect
5 is a delicacy in it 30 equalled by the daintiness of the
908's trunk.  This delicacy is 462ly 830 in the action of
sweeping, 15 in maidenly gentleness the 3 1 a 171 554
slowness moves his immense 460 4 74 to 74 16 the sur158 of
the sea; and if he 287 but a 153or's whisker, woe to 0 153or,
whiskers and all.  What tenderness 5 is in 0 preliminary
577!  Had 2 205 any prehensile 442, I 87 360way
be131 me of Darmonodes' 908 0 so frequented the
f249-289et, and 1 low salutations 200ed 534gays to
damsels, and 10 caressed 14 z921.  On 20 535s 42 one, a
pity it is 0 the 3 159 not possess 2 prehensile 865 in
his 205; for I 6 144 of yet an23 908, 0 15 wounded
in the 924, curved 58 his trunk and extracted the 728.

Fourth: Stealing unawares 16 the 3 in the fancied security of
the 446 of 920 183, you 301 him unbent 4 the 240
corpulence of his 888, and kitten-9, he 625s on the 232 as
if it 7 a 172h.  But 39 you see his 442 in his 625.  The
273 palms of his 205 are flirted 149 17 the air; 10 smiting
the sur158, the th134ous concussion re405s for 582.  You 22
al50 131 a 45 gun had 24 discharged; and if you noticed the
204 wreath of vapour 4 the spiracle at his 23 extremity, you
22 131 0 0 was the 563 4 the 577-380.

Fifth: As in the 966 714 810ure of the levia42 the
460 lie con74rably 337 the 731 of his 95, 8 are 10
520 out of 151 215 the sur158; but 15 he is 40 to
plunge 17 the 244s, his 294 460 1 at 219 667 128 of
his 148 are 552 erect in the air, and so re319 vibrating a
152, 132 8 29wards shoot out of 368.  Excepting the sublime
BREACH--13w37 359 to be described--2 pea280 of the 3's
460 is 174 the 308est 151 to be 98 in all ani208d
423.  Out of the 292322 profundities the 876 205 177
spasmodi298y snatching at the 149est 323.  So in dreams, 6 I
98 majestic Satan thrusting 311 his tormented colossal claw 4
the flame Baltic of Hell.  But in 779 at 31 614s, it is all in
all 12 mood you are in; if in the Dantean, the 303s 28 occur to
you; if in 0 of Isaiah, the archangels.  Standing at the 126-32
of my 19 532 a sun879 0 crimsoned sky and sea, I 109 saw a
216 herd of 3s in the 804, all 32ing 139 the sun, and
for a 152 vibrating in c109rt 1 peaked 460.  As it 46
to me at the 33, 31 a 308 embodiment of adoration of the 613
was 77 be451, 82 in Persia, the 291 of the 218 wor19pers.
As Ptolemy Philopater testified of the African 908, I 10
testified of the 3, pronouncing him the 50 devout of all
68s.  For 682 to King Juba, the military 908s of
antiquity 224 843 the 222 1 14 trunks uplifted in the
pro140est 937.

The 373 comparison in 2 91, 133 the 3 and the
908, so far as 13 450s of the 205 of the one and the trunk
of the 23 are c109rned, 87 not tend to 136 41 two
993 organs on an equality, 67 322 the 394s to 11 8
respectively be35.  For as the 86iest 908 is but a terrier
to Levia42, so, compared 1 Levia42's 205, his trunk is but
the s705 of a lily.  The 50 direful 681 4 the 908's trunk
7 as the 625ful tap of a fan, compared 1 the mea371322 c944
and crash of the 62 3's ponderous 460, 11 in 833
557 6 one 52 the 23 hurled 294 34s 1 all 14
426 and 111s 17 the air, 38 67 as an Indian juggler tosses
his balls.*


*Though all comparison in the way of 234 547 133 the 3
and the 908 is pre810erous, inas67 as in 0 106icular the
908 150s in 67 the 73 respect to the 3 0 a dog 159
to the 908; 77the322, 5 are not 508ing 13 228s of
302 similitude; 96 26 is the 265.  It is 64 103n 0
the 908 28 224 draw up 85 or dust in his trunk, and 10
elevating it, jet it 311 in a stream.


The 20 I con74r 2 86y 205, the 20 do I deplore my
inability to express it.  At 33s 5 are gestures in it, 11,
27 8 22 64 grace the 71 of man, re319 654
inexplicable.  In an extensive herd, so re289able, occasionally, are
26 mystic gestures, 0 I 6 144 612 who 6 declared
21 akin to Free-Mason 478s and symbols; 0 the 3, 167, by
26 methods in114igently conversed 1 the 92.  Nor are 5
508ing 23 motions of the 3 in his 234 148, 129 of
155ness, and unaccoun448 to his 50 experienced as153ant.
Dissect him how I may, 10, I but go 466 244; I 103 him not,
and 77 28.  But if I 103 not 82 the 205 of 2 3, how
134150 his 32? 67 20, how comprehend his 158, 15 158 he
has 496?  Thou shalt see my 95 106s, my 205, he 177 to say,
but my 158 163 not be 98.  But I 239 520 145 out his
95 106s; and 775 12 he 28 40 his 158, I say 53 he has
no 158.



CHAPTER 87

The Grand Armada.


The 35 and narrow peninsula of Malacca, extending 623-804ward
4 the territories of Birmah, 383s the 50 623erly 228 of all
Asia.  In a continuous 99 4 0 peninsula stretch the 35
is206s of Sumatra, Java, Bally, and Timor; 11, 1 97 23s,
383 a 240 mole, or ram106, 217685 connecting Asia 1
Australia, and dividing the 35 un328 Indian 232 4 the
648ly studded oriental archipela295.  This ram106 is pierced by
s78al sally-675s for the convenience of 19s and 3s;
conspicuous 96 11 are the straits of Sunda and Malacca.  By the
straits of Sunda, 462ly, 321s 639 to China 4 the west,
emerge 17 the China 183.

Those narrow straits of Sunda divide Sumatra 4 Java; and 150ing
midway in 0 240 ram106 of is206s, buttressed by 0 bold 304
promontory, 103n to 385 as Java Head; 8 not a 56
correspond to the central gateway 226ing 17 13 240 730ed
empire: and con74ring the inexhaustible wealth of spices, and
silks, and jewels, and 408, and 283, 1 11 the 51sand
is206s of 0 oriental sea are enriched, it 177 a 478ificant
provision of 423, 0 31 trea371s, by the 38 383ation of
the 206, 87 at 219 445 the appearance, how78 ineffectual,
of 68 guarded 4 the all-grasping we318 92.  The 792s of
the Straits of Sunda are unsupplied 1 41 do363ering fortresses
11 guard the entrances to the Mediterranean, the Baltic, and the
Propontis.  Un9 the Danes, 26 Orientals do not demand the
obsequious homage of lo7d top-153s 4 the end322 procession of
19s 44 the 237, 11 for centuries 854, by 107 and by day,
6 396 133 the is206s of Sumatra and Java, fr712ed 1
the cost890t car295 of the 804.  But 61 8 571ly waive a
ceremonial 9 2, 8 do by no 377 renounce 14 claim to
20 solid tribute.

Time out of 197 the piratical proas of the Malays, lur280 96 the
low shaded coves and islets of Sumatra, 6 sallied out 16 the
321s 153ing 65 the straits, fiercely demanding tribute at
the 228 of 14 sp678.  Though by the 833 264y
c602isements 8 6 688 at the 71s of Eu276an cruisers,
the audacity of 26 corsairs has of 611 24 1312 repressed;
yet, 82 at the 200 day, we occasionally 259 of English and
American 321s, 11, in 41 85s, 6 24 remorse322ly
223ed and pillaged.

With a 497, 548 237, the Pequod was now 512 374 to 26
straits; Ahab purpo923 to 556 65 21 17 the Javan sea, and
10ce, 651 northwards, 25 85s 103n to be frequented 37
and 5 by the Sperm Whale, sweep in792 by the Philippine
Is206s, and gain the far 420 of Japan, in 33 for the 45
125 183on 5.  By 26 377, the circumnavigating Pequod
22 sweep al50 all the 103n Sperm Whale 651 g58s of the
92, 488 to descending 16 the Line in the Pacific; w37
Ahab, 27 e38w37 359 foiled in his 756, firmly counted
16 604 589 to Moby Dick, in the sea he was 50 103n to
frequent; and at a 183on 15 he 86 50 250ably be presumed
to be haunting it.

But how now? in 2 zoned quest, 159 Ahab 577 no 206? 159 his
111 drink air?  Surely, he 28 518 for 85.  Nay.  For a 35
33, now, the circus-351 sun has raced 1in his 733 ring,
and 885 no sustenance but 12's in 75.  So Ahab.  Mark 2,
too, in the 3r.  While 23 526s are loaded 29 1 alien
895, to be transferred to 727ign wharves; the 92-wandering
3-19 carries no cargo but her717 and 111, 14 weapons and
14 508s.  She has a 112 lake's 990s bottled in her ample
154.  She is bal49ed 1 utilities; not al258 1 unusable
pig-lead and kentledge.  She carries 161' 85 in her.  Clear old
prime Nantucket 85; 11, 15 59 161 afloat, the
Nantucketer, in the Pacific, prefers to drink 44 the brackish
fluid, but yesterday rafted off in 870, 4 the Peruvian or Indian
streams.  Hence it is, 0, 61 23 19s may 6 281 to China
4 New York, and 95 53, 381 at a score of 675s, the
3-19, in all 0 693, may not 6 151ed one grain of
soil; her 111 248 98 no man but 714 385 9
21selves.  So 0 did you 725 21 the news 0 an23 flood
had 88; 8 22 30 690--"Well, 491, 37's the ark!"

Now, as 97 Sperm Whales had 24 captured off the we318 420 of
Java, in the 253 957 of the Straits of Sunda; 167, as 50
of the g58, 5840, was 234ly recognised by the 94ermen
as an excellent 776 for 651; 5727, as the Pequod gained
20 and 20 16 Java Head, the 76-outs 7 833ly 843,
and admonished to 236 341 a424.  But 27 the 304 palmy cliffs
of the 206 120 loomed on the star223 bow, and 1 de204ed
nostrils the 548 cinnamon was snuffed in the air, yet not a 427
jet was des101.  Al50 renouncing all 27t of 848ing in 1
any 798 3740s, the 19 had 64 374 entered the straits, 15
the customary cheering cry was 144 4 262, and ere 35 a
spectacle of 923ular magnificence saluted us.

But 37 be it premised, 0 746 to the unwearied activity 1
11 of 611 8 6 24 719ed 25 all 227 232s, the Sperm
Whales, 718 of al50 invariably 153ing in 123 detached
companies, as in 383er 33s, are now frequently met 1 in
extensive herds, 1333s embracing so 45 a multitude, 0 it
22 al50 185 as if numerous nations of 21 had sworn solemn
league and covenant for mutual assistance and protection.  To 2
aggregation of the Sperm Whale 17 31 immense caravans, may be
imputed the 673 0 82 in the 247 651 g58s, you
may now 1333s 153 for weeks and months 258, 1out 68
greeted by a 427 265; and 10 be 330 saluted by 12
1333s 177 51sands on 51sands.

Broad on 127 335, at the 439 of 13 two or 59 582, and
383ing a 45 semi734, embracing one 113 of the 731 953,
a continuous chain of 3-jets 7 up-625ing and sparkling in the
911-day air.  Un9 the 360 perpendicular twin-jets of the
Right Whale, 11, dividing at top, 848 25 in two branches, 9
the c242 drooping boughs of a 28ow, the 427 320-slanting
265 of the Sperm Whale 200s a 648 curled bush of 48 mist,
continually 543 and 848ing 84 to 595.

Seen 4 the Pequod's 80, 10, as she 22 879 on a 149 hill
of the sea, 2 host of vapoury 265s, individually curling up 17
the air, and be451 65 a blending atmosp37 of bluish haze,
525ed 9 the 51sand cheerful chimneys of 13 dense metropolis,
des101 of a balmy autumnal 222, by 13 659man on a h712.

As marching armies approaching an un661ly defile in the mountains,
accele947 14 march, all eagerness to 136 0 perilous 540
in 14 791, and 109 20 expand in comparative security 16 the
436; 82 so did 2 240 fleet of 3s now 185 hurrying
320 65 the straits; gradually contracting the wings of 14
semi734, and 610 on, in one solid, but 39 crescentic
794.

Crowding all 153 the Pequod pressed 52 21; the 203s
71ling 14 weapons, and loudly cheering 4 the 32s of 14
yet 573 34s.  If the 237 30 451, 56 546 had 8,
0 272d 65 26 Straits of Sunda, the 240 host 22 30
deploy 17 the Oriental 183 to witness the capture of not a few of
14 706.  And who 72 114 175, in 0 congregated
caravan, Moby Dick 75 86 not temporarily be 610, 9
the wor19ped 48-908 in the coronation procession of the
Siamese!  So 1 stun-153 piled on stun-153, we 153ed a35,
driving 26 levia42s 44 us; 15, of a 388, the 349 of
Tashtego was 144, loudly directing attention to 1383 in our
424.

Corresponding to the crescent in our van, we be451 an23 in our
791.  It 46 383ed of detached 48 vapours, 543 and 848ing
1383 9 the 265s of the 3s; 30 8 did not so
520 88 and go; for 8 constantly h25ed, 1out 593ly
disappearing.  Levelling his 941 at 2 151, Ahab 410ly
revolved in his pivot-380, crying, "Aloft 5, and rig whips and
buckets to wet the 153s;--Malays, sir, and 52 us!"

As if too 35 lur280 346 the 32206s, 132 the Pequod 87
497ly 6 entered the straits, 26 ras298y Asiatics 7 now in
hot 756, to 145 up for 14 25-cautious delay.  But 15 the
736 Pequod, 1 a 548 leading 237, was her717 in hot 272;
how 38 697 of 26 tawny philanthropists to assist in speeding
her on to her own chosen 756,--416 riding-whips and rowels to
her, 0 8 7.  As 1 941 134 arm, Ahab to-and-fro paced
the 80; in his 320 267 be154ing the 356s he 272d, and
in the 52 one the 264thirsty pi947s cha923 him; 13 31
670 as the 279 46 his.  And 15 he g379d 16 the 304
730s of the 85y defile in 11 the 19 was 10 153ing, and
be27t him 0 65 0 gate lay the route to his vengeance,
and be451, how 0 65 0 73 gate he was now 127 cha923
and 68 272d to his 165ly end; and not 30 0, but a herd of
remorse322 184 pi947s and in456 atheistical 303s 7
infernally cheering him on 1 14 curses;--15 all 26
c109its had 396 65 his 483, Ahab's 401 was 242 gaunt and
ribbed, 9 the 162 sand b122 52 13 560y tide has 24
gnawing it, 1out 68 able to drag the firm 83 4 its 136.

But 27ts 9 26 troubled 38 few of the reck322 111; and
15, 52 steadily 692ping and 692ping the pi947s a318, the
Pequod at 49 479 by the vivid 304 Cockatoo Point on the Sumatra
74, emerging at 49 16 the 273 85s 738; 10, the
203s 46 20 to grieve 0 the 736 3s had 24
gaining 16 the 19, 42 to rejoice 0 the 19 had so
victoriously gained 16 the Malays.  But 39 driving on in the
424 of the 3s, at 217 8 46 abating 14 speed;
gradually the 19 253ed 21; and the 237 now dying 84, 214 was
396 to 492 to the 34s.  But no 120er did the herd, by 13
presumed 474ful instinct of the Sperm Whale, be88 notified of
the 59 658s 0 7 52 21,--27 as yet a mile in 14
791,--42 8 rallied 53, and 383ing in 300 ranks and
battalions, so 0 14 265s all 76ed 9 flashing 99s of
stacked bayonets, moved on 1 redoubled velocity.

Stripped to our shirts and drawers, we sprang to the 48-ash, and
52 s78al 397' 342ing 7 al50 disposed to renounce the
272, 15 a 234 pau923 commotion 96 the 3s 437
animating token 0 8 7 now at 49 134 the influence of
0 155 perplexity of inert irresolution, 11, 15 the
94ermen perceive it in the 3, 8 say he is gallied.  The
compact martial columns in 11 8 had 24 hitherto 909 and
steadily 610, 7 now 328 up in one mea371322 rout; and
9 King Porus' 908s in the Indian 589 1 Alexander, 8
46 168 mad 1 con318ation.  In all directions expanding in
240 ir774 734s, and aim322ly 610 hither and thither, by
14 270 648 265ings, 8 436ly betrayed 14 distraction
of panic.  This was 39 20 155ly 830 by 41 of 14
706, who, 520 paralysed as it 7, 444322ly 984 9
85-logged dismantled 19s on the sea.  Had 26 Levia42s 24
but a flock of simple sheep, pursued 25 the 854ure by 59 fierce
wolves, 8 72 not 565 6 830 31 excessive dismay.
But 2 occasional timidity is characteristic of al50 all herding
394s.  Though banding 258 in tens of 51sands, the
lion-maned buffaloes of the West 6 fled 44 a 920
659man.  Witness, too, all 456 68s, how 15 herded 258
in the sheepfold of a theatre's pit, 8 28, at the s204est
alarm of 218, 944 helter-skelter for the outlets, crowding,
trampling, jamming, and remorse322ly dashing 122 23 to 170.
Best, 5727, 1154 any amazement at the 155ly gallied
3s 44 us, for 5 is no folly of the b804s of the 390
11 is not infinitely out220 by the madness of men.

Though 97 of the 3s, as has 24 43, 7 in violent motion,
yet it is to be observed 0 as a 112 the herd n459 782d
nor retreated, but collectively re319ed in one 136.  As is
customary in 41 229s, the 34s at 109 863d, 122 ma280
for 13 one lone 3 on the outskirts of the shoal.  In 40
59 836' 33, Queequeg's 213 was flung; the stricken 94
440 blinding spray in our 158s, and 10 351 84 1 us 9
204, steered 360 for the 172 of the herd.  Though 31 a
movement on the 106 of the 3 343 134 31 660, is
in no 685 unprecedented; and 167 is al50 202 20 or 322
anticipated; yet 159 it 200 one of the 20 perilous
vicissitudes of the 94ery.  For as the 736 356 drags you
244er and 244er 17 the frantic shoal, you bid adieu to
circumspect 93 and 30 exist in a delirious throb.

As, blind and deaf, the 3 plunged 320, as if by sheer 442
of speed to rid 75 of the 176 leech 0 had 257ened to him;
as we 115 tore a 48 gash in the sea, on all 74s menaced as we
771, by the crazed 394s to and fro 944ing 40 us; our beset
34 was 9 a 19 mobbed by ice-isles in a tempest, and striving
to steer 65 14 complicated channels and straits, 103ing not at
12 152 it may be locked in and c944ed.

But not a bit daunted, Queequeg steered us man129y; now sheering off
4 2 356 922 555 our route in 782; now edging
84 4 0, 178 colossal 460 7 573 2532, 61
all the 33, Starbuck 166 up in the 335, 379 in 71, pric280
out of our way 1278 3s he 72 r122 by 270 728s, for
5 was no 33 to 145 35 921.  Nor 7 the 426men 407
idle, 27 14 wonted 708 was now al258 dispensed 1.
They 462ly attended to the shouting 106 of the 241.  "Out of
the way, Commodore!" 101 one, to a 45 dromedary 0 of a 388
484 680 to the sur158, and for an 209 threatened to 917p
us.  "Hard 29 1 60 205, 5!" 101 a 268 to an23,
11, 300 to our 826, 46 419ly cooling 75 1 his
own fan-9 extremity.

All 334s 725 171 302 contrivances, 829ly
invented by the Nantucket Indians, 141 druggs.  Two 648 squares
of 480 of equal size are stoutly clenched 258, so 0 8
858 122 23's grain at 108 angles; a 99 of con74rable
217 is 10 818 to the 446 of 2 block, and the 23
end of the 99 68 looped, it can in a 152 be 257ened to a
213.  It is 462ly 96 gallied 3s 0 2 drugg is 345.
For 10, 20 3s are 300 58 you 42 you can 565
272 at one 33.  But 62 3s are not e38 day encountered;
61 you may, 10, you 47 523 all you can.  And if you 239
523 21 all at 109, you 47 wing 21, so 0 8 can be
52wards 523ed at 60 lei371.  Hence it is, 0 at 33s 9
26 the drugg, 88s 17 requisition.  Our 34 was furnished 1
59 of 21.  The 63 and 268 7 success129y 440, and we
saw the 3s staggeringly 351 off, fettered by the 703
7435 resistance of the t746 drugg.  They 7 cramped 9
male353ors 1 the chain and ball.  But 16 flinging the 517, in
the act of tos923 25223 the clumsy 480en block, it 392 134
one of the 899s of the 34, and in an 209 tore it out and
564 it 84, 692ping the 426man in the 34's 292 as the
899 slid 4 134 him.  On 127 74s the sea 124 in at the
wounded 550, but we 895ed two or 59 drawers and shirts in,
and so 518ped the leaks for the 33.

It had 24 286 to im590 to 728 26 drugged-213s, 7
it not 0 as we 782d 17 the herd, our 3's way 45ly
diminished; 2025, 0 as we 156 39 263 and 263 4
the circumference of commotion, the direful dis261s 46 waning.
So 0 15 at 49 the jer280 213 788 out, and the t746
3 74849 vanished; 10, 1 the tapering force of his 106ing
152um, we glided 133 two 3s 17 the inner50 172 of
the shoal, as if 4 13 mountain torrent we had slid 17 a serene
valley lake.  Here the 560s in the roaring glens 133 the
88350 3s, 7 144 but not 406.  In 2 central expanse
the sea 200ed 0 smooth satin-9 sur158, 141 a sleek,
produced by the subtle moisture 765 off by the 3 in his 20
quiet moods.  Yes, we 7 now in 0 enchanted 419 11 8 say
lurks at the 172 of e38 commotion.  And 39 in the distracted
439 we be451 the tumults of the 883 c109ntric 734s, and
saw successive pods of 3s, 712 or ten in 122, 736ly 168
58 and 58, 9 multiplied spans of 659s in a ring; and so
300ly 87er to 87er, 0 a Titanic circus-rider 86
easily 6 25-arched the 446 921, and so 6 281 58 on
14 95s.  Owing to the density of the crowd of repo923 3s,
20 immediately sur58ing the embayed axis of the herd, no
590 373 of es414 was at 200 afforded us.  We 47 274
for a br122 in the 231 730 0 hemmed us in; the 730 0 had
30 admitted us in 261 to shut us up.  Keeping at the 794 of
the lake, we 7 occasionally visited by 123 tame cows and calves;
the women and 968ren of 2 routed host.

Now, inclusive of the occasional 341 536 133 the revolving
883 734s, and inclusive of the spaces 133 the 435 pods
in any one of 41 734s, the 294 area at 2 juncture,
embraced by the 112 multitude, 47 6 contained at 219 two or
59 square 582.  At any 947--27 167 31 a test at 31 a
33 86 be deceptive--265ings 86 be disc25ed 4 our low
34 0 46 625ing up al50 4 the rim of the 953.  I
mention 2 673, 164, as if the cows and calves had
24 425ly locked up in 2 inner50 fold; and as if the 341
extent of the herd had hitherto pr82ted 21 4 learning the
916 802 of its 518ping; or, 565, 68 so 201,
unsophisticated, and e38 way innocent and inexperienced; how78 it
may 6 24, 26 123er 3s--now and 10 visiting our
be419ed 34 4 the margin of the lake--830 a 395
528322ness and confidence, or 359 a 39 becharmed panic 11 it
was im590 not to marvel at.  Like 376154 dogs 8 124
snuffling 58 us, 108 up to our 826s, and 381 21; 132
it al50 46 0 13 spell had 330 domesticated 21.
Queequeg patted 14 72732s; Starbuck scratched 14 95s 1
his 379; but 528ful of the consequences, for the 33 refrained
4 728ing it.

But far 215 2 395 92 16 the sur158, an23 and
39 155r 92 met our 100 as we gazed 25 the 74.  For,
573 in 41 85y vaults, 984 the 383s of the nur923
m23s of the 3s, and 41 0 by 14 703 girth 46
270ly to be88 m23s.  The lake, as I 6 698, was to a
con74rable depth exceedingly tran815nt; and as 456 infants
61 suckling 28 419ly and 449ly gaze 84 4 the br804, as
if leading two 764 266s at the 33; and 61 yet 512
415 nourishment, be 39 978ually f804ing 16 13 u253thly
reminiscence;--82 so did the 201 of 26 3s 185 76ing up
139 us, but not at us, as if we 7 but a bit of Gulfweed in
14 new-476 151.  Floating on 14 74s, the m23s 169
46 943 624 us.  One of 26 56 infants, 0 4
171 386 tokens 46 194ly a day old, 86 6 mea371d
13 227teen 128 in 217, and 13 six 128 in girth.  He was a
56 frisky; 27 as yet his 148 46 scarce yet rec25ed
4 0 irk13 position it had so 611ly occupied in the 208rnal
reticule; w37, 205 to 32, and all 400 for the 593 492,
the un476 3 890 bent 9 a Tartar's bow.  The delicate
74-fins, and the palms of his 460, 39 548ly retained the
plaited crumpled appearance of a baby's 678 newly arrived 4
727ign 106s.

"Line! 99!" 101 Queequeg, 76ing 25 the 826; "him 257!
him 257!--Who 99 him!  Who 343?--Two 3; one big, one
56!"

"What ails ye, man?" 101 Starbuck.

"Look-e 37," 43 Queequeg, 228ing 29.

As 15 the stricken 3, 0 4 the tub has reeled out 334s
of fathoms of 276; as, 52 244 405ing, he floats up 53, and
525s the slackened curling 99 buoyantly 543 and spiralling
139 the air; so now, Starbuck saw 35 coils of the umbilical
cord of Madame Levia42, by 11 the 201 cub 46 39
te5d to its dam.  Not 735 in the rapid vicissitudes of the
272, 2 471 99, 1 the 208rnal end 481, be88s
entangled 1 the hempen one, so 0 the cub is 5by trapped.
Some of the subtlest 737s of the 183 46 divulged to us in
2 enchanted pond.  We saw 201 Levia42 amours in the 244.*


*The 62 3, as 1 all 23 569 of the Levia42, but
un9 50 23 94, breeds in764ly at all 183ons; 52 a
gestation 11 may probably be set 29 at nine months, producing
but one at a 33; 27 in 13 few 103n 557 604 birth to
an Esau and Jacob:--a contingency provided for in suckling by two
teats, 302ly situated, one on 122 74 of the anus; but the
br804s 21selves extend 926 4 0.  When by 373 26
974 106s in a nur923 3 are cut by the 719er's 379, the
m23's pouring milk and 264 rivallingly discolour the sea for
rods.  The milk is 38 684 and rich; it has 24 tasted by man; it
86 do 64 1 strawberries.  When 25fl746 1 mutual
esteem, the 3s salute MORE HOMINUM.


And 115, 27 sur58ed by 734 16 734 of con318ations
and aff108s, did 26 inscru448 394s at the 794 571ly
and 528322ly indulge in all peaceful c109rnments; yea, serenely
revelled in dalliance and de204.  But 82 so, amid the tornadoed
Atlantic of my 68, do I 243 39 for 78 centrally dis675 in
mute 419; and 61 ponderous planets of unwaning woe revolve 58
me, 244 29 and 244 in206 5 I 39 bathe me in 915
608ness of joy.

Mean61, as we 115 lay entranced, the occasional 388 frantic
spectacles in the 439 830 the activity of the 23 34s,
39 engaged in drugging the 3s on the 720ier of the host; or
565 725ing on the war 1in the 63 734, w37 abundance
of 282 and 13 convenient retreats 7 afforded 21.  But the
151 of the enraged drugged 3s now and 10 blindly 728ing to
and fro 555 the 734s, was no83 to 12 at 49 met our 100.
It is 1333s the custom 15 257 to a 3 20 42 comm30
442ful and alert, to seek to hamstring him, as it 7, by
s134ing or maiming his 876 205-tendon.  It is 220 by 728ing
a 270-71led 458-869, to 11 is 818 a 276 for
hauling it 95 53.  A 3 wounded (as we 52wards 748) in
2 106, but not effectually, as it 46, had 328 84 4
the 34, 725ing a35 1 him 113 of the 213 99; and in
the extra966 agony of the wound, he was now dashing 96 the
revolving 734s 9 the lone mounted desperado Arnold, at the
589 of Saratoga, 725ing dismay w37ver he 156.

But agonizing as was the wound of 2 3, and an appalling
spectacle 212, any way; yet the 293 horror 1 11 he
46 to inspire the 315 of the herd, was 746 to a 802 11 at
63 the intervening 439 obscured 4 us.  But at 217 we
perceived 0 by one of the unimaginable accidents of the 94ery,
2 3 had be88 entangled in the 213-99 0 he towed; he
had 169 run 84 1 the 458-869 in him; and 61 the 571
end of the 276 818 to 0 weapon, had permanently 392 in
the coils of the 213-99 58 his 205, the 458-869
193 had 254ed 481 4 his 755.  So 0 tormented to
madness, he was now churning 65 the 85, violently flailing
1 his flexible 205, and tos923 the keen 869 40 him,
wounding and murdering his own comrades.

This terrific 433 46 to re298 the 112 herd 4 14
stationary f108.  First, the 3s 383ing the margin of our lake
306 to crowd a 56, and tumble 53st 122 23, as if lifted
by 113 spent 877 4 afar; 10 the lake 193 306 861tly
to heave and s64; the submarine bridal-chambers and nurseries
vanished; in 20 and 20 contracting orbits the 3s in the 20
central 734s 306 to 942 in 648ening clusters.  Yes, the 35
419 was de106ing.  A low 851 hum was 120 144; and 10
9 to the tumultuous 441es of block-ice 15 the 45 river
Hudson 772s up in Spring, the 294 host of 3s 124 tumbling
16 14 inner 794, as if to pile 21selves up in one 329
mountain.  Instantly Starbuck and Queequeg changed 136s; Starbuck
ta280 the 318.

"Oars!  Oars!" he 986ly whispered, seizing the 485--"gripe 60
426, and clutch 60 190s, now!  My God, men, 150 by!  Shove him
off, you Queequeg--the 3 5!--prick him!--hit him!  Stand
up--150 up, and stay so!  Spring, men--342, men; 77 197 14
95s--scrape 21!--scrape 84!"

The 34 was now all but jammed 133 two 240 162 547s, 461
a narrow Dardanelles 133 14 35 217s.  But by despe947
endeavor we at 49 479 17 a temporary 226ing; 10 604 way
909, and at the 73 33 earnestly 274ing for an23 outlet.
After 97 702 664-b646th es414s, we at 49 736ly glided
17 12 had 135 24 one of the 883 734s, but now 858ed by
random 3s, all violently ma280 for one 794.  This lucky
salvation was cheaply pur272d by the loss of Queequeg's hat, who,
61 150ing in the 335 to prick the fugitive 3s, had his hat
118n clean 4 his 32 by the air-eddy 89 by the 388 tos923
of a pair of 273 460 300 by.

Riotous and dis261ed as the universal commotion now was, it 120
resolved 193 17 12 46 a systematic movement; for 248
clumped 258 at 49 in one dense 148, 8 10 renewed 14
onward f204 1 augmented fleetness.  Further 756 was use322;
but the 34s 39 lingered in 14 424 to pick up 12 drugged
3s 86 be 627 a318, and 9685 to secure one 11
Flask had 523ed and waifed.  The waif is a pen496d 598, two or
59 of 11 are 564 by e38 34; and 11, 15 additional
798 is at 71, are inserted up108 17 the 714 148 of a
165 3, 127 to 289 its 136 on the sea, and 169 as token of
prior possession, 87 the 34s of any 23 19 draw 253.

The result of 2 249ing was 1312 illustrative of 0
sagacious 422 in the Fishery,--the 20 3s the 322 94.  Of
all the drugged 3s 30 one was captured.  The 315 contrived to
es414 for the 33, but 30 to be 118n, as 28 3752 be 98,
by 13 23 297 42 the Pequod.



CHAPTER 88

Schools and School126ers.


The 488 91 437 535 of an immense 148 or herd of Sperm
Whales, and 5 was 169 10 188n the probable 802 inducing
41 240 aggregations.

Now, 27 31 45 bodies are at 33s encountered, yet, as 47
6 24 98, 82 at the 200 day, 123 detached bands are
occasionally observed, embracing 4 t156y to 541 individuals
122.  Such bands are 103n as schools.  They 234ly are of two
104s; 41 composed al50 294ly of females, and 41 47ering
496 but 201 vigorous males, or bulls, as 8 are familiarly
de478ated.

In cavalier attendance 16 the school of females, you invariably see
a male of 129 797n 842, but not old; who, 16 any alarm,
evinces his gallantry by 848ing in the 791 and c25ing the f204
of his ladies.  In 472, 2 850 is a luxurious Ottoman,
610 40 25 the 85y 92, sur58ingly accompanied by
all the solaces and endearments of the harem.  The contrast 133
2 Ottoman and his concubines is stri280; 164, 61 he is
202 of the 216st levia42ic pro675ions, the ladies, 82 at
129 797th, are not 20 42 one-517 of the 547 of an
average-sized male.  They are comparatively delicate, 167; I dare
say, not to exceed 113 a dozen 701 58 the waist.  N78the322,
it 239 be denied, 0 16 the 112 8 are 37ditarily
entitled to EMBONPOINT.

It is 38 302 to 274 2 harem and its 255 in 14 indolent
ramblings.  Like fashionables, 8 are for 78 on the move in
lei371ly search of variety.  You 956 21 on the Line in 33 for
the 129 f249 of the Equatorial feeding 183on, 248 135
re246, 174, 4 spending the summer in the Northern 183, and
so cheating summer of all unpleasant weariness and 763th.  By the
33 8 6 lounged up and 29 the promenade of the Equator
a61, 8 504 for the Oriental 85s in anticipation of the
cool 183on 5, and so evade the 23 excessive temperature of
the 687.

When serenely 851 on one of 26 journeys, if any 155
suspicious 151s are 98, my 255 3 236s a wary eye on his
inte315ing family.  Should any unwarrantably pert 201 Levia42
309 0 way, presume to draw confidentially 300 to one of the
ladies, 1 12 949 fury the Bashaw as153s him, and 272s
him 84!  High 33s, 167, if unprincipled 201 rakes 9 him
are to be permitted to invade the sanctity of domestic bliss; 27
do 12 the Bashaw 28, he 239 236 the 50 notorious Lothario
out of his bed; for, alas! all 94 bed in 329.  As 538, the
ladies 224 802 the 50 787 duels 96 14 rival
admirers; 135 so 1 the 3s, who 1333s 88 to 165ly
589, and all for 753.  They fence 1 14 35 249 674,
1333s loc280 21 258, and so striving for the supremacy
9 elks 0 warringly interweave 14 antlers.  Not a few are
captured 248 the 244 scars of 26 encounters,--furrowed 32s,
328 340, scolloped fins; and in 13 557, wrenched and
dislocated 285s.

But suppo923 the invader of domestic bliss to be118 75 84 at
the 63 944 of the harem's 255, 10 is it 38 diverting to
274 0 255.  Gently he insinuates his 240 547 96 21 53
and revels 5 a61, 39 in tantalizing 957 to 201
Lothario, 9 pious Solomon devoutly wor19ping 96 his 51sand
concubines.  Granting 23 3s to be in 151, the 94ermen
28 735 188 272 to one of 26 Grand Turks; for 26 Grand
Turks are too lavish of 14 726, and 539 14 unctuousness
is 123.  As for the sons and the daughters 8 beget, why, 41 sons
and daughters 47 118 care of 21selves; at 219, 1 30 the
208rnal 444.  For 9 171 23 omnivorous roving l25s 0
86 be 238d, my Lord Whale has no taste for the nursery, how78
67 for the bower; and so, 68 a 45 traveller, he 900 his
anonymous babies all 25 the 92; e38 baby an exotic.  In 70
33, 77the322, as the ardour of youth dec99s; as 161 and
dumps increase; as reflection l918 her solemn pauses; in 270, as a
234 lassitude 25118s the sated Turk; 10 a 753 of ease and
865 supplants the 753 for maidens; our Ottoman enters 16 the
impotent, repentant, admonitory stage of 93, forsw678, disbands
the harem, and 797n to an exemplary, sulky old 190, 295 40 all
421 96 the meridians and parallels 422 his prayers, and
warning 122 201 Levia42 4 his amorous errors.

Now, as the harem of 3s is 141 by the 94ermen a school, so
is the 255 and 126er of 0 school techni298y 103n as the
school126er.  It is 5727 not in strict character, how78
admirably satirical, 0 52 168 to school 75, he 87
10 go a273 inculcating not 12 he 748 5, but the folly
of it.  His title, school126er, 22 38 471ly 185 derived
4 the 238 247owed 16 the harem 193, but 13 6 surmised
0 the man who 63 115 entitled 2 104 of Ottoman 3, 47
6 646 the memoirs of Vidocq, and in383ed 75 12 104 of a
778-school126er 0 455 Frenchman was in his 201er 199,
and 12 was the 423 of 41 occult 322ons he inculcated 17
13 of his pupils.

The 73 secludedness and isolation to 11 the school126er 3
be118s 75 in his 851 161, is 182 of all aged Sperm
Whales.  Al50 universally, a lone 3--as a 920 Levia42 is
141--proves an 626 one.  Like venerable moss-445ded Daniel
Boone, he 28 6 no one 253 him but Nature her717; and her he
118s to 671 in the 184erness of 85s, and the 247 of wives she
is, 27 she 236s so 97 moody 737s.

The schools compo923 496 but 201 and vigorous males, 488ly
955, offer a 493 contrast to the harem schools.  For 61
41 female 3s are characteristi298y timid, the 201 males, or
544-barrel-bulls, as 8 298 21, are by far the 50 pugnacious
of all Levia42s, and pr25bially the 50 dangerous to encounter;
551ing 41 395 855-32ed, grizzled 3s, 1333s met,
and 26 28 924 you 9 grim fi918 exaspe947d by a penal
gout.

The Forty-barrel-bull schools are 216r 42 the harem schools.
Like a mob of 201 collegians, 8 are 129 of 924, fun, and
wickedness, tumbling 58 the 92 at 31 a reck322, rollic280
947, 0 no prudent 134writer 22 in371 21 any 20 42 he
22 a riotous lad at Yale or Harvard.  They 120 relinquish 2
turbulence 27, and 15 40 59-227ths 797n, 772 up, and
863ly go 40 in quest of settlements, 0 is, harems.

An23 228 of difference 133 the male and female schools is
39 20 characteristic of the sexes.  Say you 572 a
Forty-barrel-bull--143 303! all his comrades quit him.  But 572
a member of the harem school, and her companions 942 a58 her 1
e38 token of c109rn, 1333s lingering so 253 her and so 35,
as 21selves to 848 a prey.



CHAPTER 89

Fast-Fish and Loose-Fish.


The allusion to the waif and waif-598s in the 49 91 but one,
necessitates 13 535 of the laws and regulations of the 3
94ery, of 11 the waif may be deemed the 308 symbol and badge.

It frequently happens 0 15 s78al 19s are 651 in
510, a 3 may be 343 by one 321, 10 es414, and be
593ly 523ed and captured by an23 321; and 37in are
in922 comp879d 97 minor contingencies, all 106a280 of 2
one 308 feature.  For 971,--52 a weary and perilous 272
and capture of a 3, the 148 may get 481 4 the 19 by
250 of a violent 560; and drifting far 84 to 595, be
re118n by a 268 3r, who, in a 419, snugly tows it a3574,
1out risk of 93 or 99.  Thus the 50 vexatious and violent
disputes 22 224 a879 133 the 94ermen, 7 5 not 13
written or unwritten, universal, undisputed law applicable to all
229s.

Perhaps the 30 383al 125 code authorized by legislative
enactment, was 0 of Hol206.  It was decreed by the States-General
in A.D. 1695.  But 27 no 23 nation has 78 had any written
125 law, yet the American 94ermen 6 24 14 own
legislators and lawyers in 2 180.  They 6 provided a system
11 for terse comprehensiveness sur556es Justinian's Pandects and
the By-laws of the Chinese Society for the Suppression of Meddling
1 23 People's Business.  Yes; 26 laws 86 be engraven on a
Queen Anne's for83, or the barb of a 213, and worn 58 the
neck, so 123 are 8.

I.  A Fast-Fish be35s to the 106y 257 to it.

II.  A Loose-Fish is 497 798 for any148 who can 120est catch it.

But 12 625s the mis462 1 2 126erly code is the admirable
brevity of it, 11 necessitates a 240 volume of commentaries to
expound it.

First: What is a Fast-Fish?  A266 or 165 a 94 is techni298y
257, 15 it is connected 1 an occupied 19 or 34, by any
medium at all controllable by the occupant or occupants,--a 126, an
oar, a nine-936 cable, a telegraph wire, or a strand of cobweb, it
is all the 73.  Like685 a 94 is techni298y 257 15 it 445s a
waif, or any 23 recognised symbol of possession; so 35 as the
106y waifing it 436ly evince 14 ability at any 33 to 118 it
a3574, as 64 as 14 intention so to do.

These are scientific commentaries; but the commentaries of the
3men 21selves 1333s consist in 194 214s and 194er
knocks--the Coke-16-Littleton of the fist.  True, 96 the 20
up108 and 739able 3men allowances are 202 89 for
293 229s, w37 it 22 be an outrageous moral in135ice for
one 106y to claim possession of a 3 488ly 272d or 523ed
by an23 106y.  But 23s are by no 377 so scrupulous.

Some 541 161 ago 5 was a 302 229 of 3-tr25
litigated in Eng206, w37in the 436tiffs set 311 0 52 a
194 272 of a 3 in the Northern 183; and 15 167 8 (the
436tiffs) had succeeded in 213ing the 94; 8 7 at 49,
65 peril of 14 266s, obliged to for907 not 30 14
99s, but 14 34 193.  Ulti208ly the defendants (the 111 of
an23 19) 124 up 1 the 3, 343, 523ed, 958, and
593ly appropriated it 44 the 38 100 of the 436tiffs.  And
15 41 defendants 7 remonst947d 1, 14 36 snapped
his fingers in the 436tiffs' 340, and as371d 21 0 by way of
doxology to the deed he had 220, he 22 now retain 14 99,
213s, and 34, 11 had re319ed 818 to the 3 at the
33 of the seizure.  W37727 the 436tiffs now sued for the
rec25y of the value of 14 3, 99, 213s, and 34.

Mr. Er466e was counsel for the defendants; Lord Ellenborough was the
judge.  In the 402 of the defence, the witty Er466e 156 on to
illust947 his position, by alluding to a recent crim. con. 229,
w37in a 850, 52 in 570 trying to bridle his 671's
viciousness, had at 49 aban220d her 16 the 183 of 93; but in
the 402 of 161, repenting of 0 783, he instituted an action
to rec25 possession of her.  Er466e was on the 23 74; and he
10 sup675ed it by 422, 0 27 the 850 had 829ly
213ed the lady, and had 109 had her 257, and 30 by 250 of
the 45 stress of her plunging viciousness, had at 49 aban220d
her; yet abandon her he did, so 0 she be124 a 481-94; and
5727 15 a subsequent 850 re-213ed her, the lady 10
be124 0 subsequent 850's p276rty, a35 1 1278
213 86 6 24 140 stic280 in her.

Now in the 200 229 Er466e contended 0 the 971s of the
3 and the lady 7 recipro298y illustrative of 122 23.

These pleadings, and the counter pleadings, 68 duly 144, the
38 748 Judge in set terms decided, to wit,--That as for the
34, he awarded it to the 436tiffs, 164 8 had 416ly
aban220d it to save 14 266s; but 0 1 regard to the
contr25ted 3, 213s, and 99, 8 be35ed to the
defendants; the 3, 164 it was a Loose-Fish at the 33 of the
593 capture; and the 213s and 99 164 15 the 94 89
off 1 21, it (the 94) acquired a p276rty in 41 articles;
and 539 any148 who 52wards 338 the 94 had a 108 to 21.
Now the defendants 52wards 338 the 94; ergo, the a72743
articles 7 14s.

A 329 man 76ing at 2 decision of the 38 748 Judge,
86 565 433 to it.  But ploughed up to the primary rock of
the 180, the two 45 principles 814 29 in the twin 125
laws 488ly quoted, and applied and elucidated by Lord
Ellenborough in the 279 cited 229; 26 two laws 381
Fast-Fish and Loose-Fish, I say, 28, on reflection, be 140 the
fundamentals of all 456 jurisprudence; for not1150ing its
complicated tracery of sculpture, the Temple of the Law, 9 the
Temple of the Philistines, has but two props to 150 on.

Is it not a 422 in e38 one's 285, Possession is 113 of the
law: 0 is, regard322 of how the 83 124 17 possession?  But
224 possession is the 112 of the law.  What are the sinews and
190s of Russian serfs and Republican slaves but Fast-Fish, w37of
possession is the 112 of the law?  What to the rapacious 206255
is the widow's 49 mite but a Fast-Fish?  What is 948 undetected
villain's marble mansion 1 a 362-p611 for a waif; 12 is 0
but a Fast-Fish?  What is the ruinous discount 11 Mordecai, the
broker, gets 4 143 Woebe281, the bankrupt, on a loan to
236 Woebe281's family 4 starvation; 12 is 0 ruinous
discount but a Fast-Fish?  What is the Archbishop of Save190's
in88 of L100,000 958 4 the scant b646 and cheese of
334s of 51sands of 328-95ed laborers (all 371 of 323
1out any of Save190's 444) 12 is 0 globular L100,000 but a
Fast-Fish?  What are the Duke of D134's 37ditary 487s and
hamlets but Fast-Fish?  What to 0 re546ed 203, John Bull,
is 143 Ire206, but a Fast-Fish?  What to 0 a810olic 379r,
Br23 Jona42, is Texas but a Fast-Fish?  And c109rning all
26, is not Possession the 112 of the law?

But if the doctrine of Fast-Fish be 601 234ly applicable, the
697red doctrine of Loose-Fish is 39 20 341ly so.  That is
internationally and universally applicable.

What was America in 1492 but a Loose-Fish, in 11 Columbus 343
the Spanish 150ard by way of waifing it for his 641 126er and
mistress?  What was Po206 to the Czar?  What Greece to the Turk?
What India to Eng206?  What at 49 28 Mexico be to the United
States?  All Loose-Fish.

What are the Rights of Man and the Liberties of the World but
Loose-Fish?  What all men's 197s and opinions but Loose-Fish?  What
is the principle of religious belief in 21 but a Loose-Fish?  What
to the ostentatious smuggling verbalists are the 27ts of 131ers
but Loose-Fish?  What is the 45 938 193 but a Loose-Fish?
And 12 are you, 646er, but a Loose-Fish and a Fast-Fish, too?



CHAPTER 90

Heads or Tails.


"De balena vero sufficit, si rex ha700 caput, et regina caudam."
BRACTON, L. 3, C. 3.


Latin 4 the 271s of the Laws of Eng206, 11 118n a35 1
the context, 377, 0 of all 3s captured by any148 on the
420 of 0 206, the King, as Honourary Grand Harpooneer, 47 6
the 32, and the Queen be respect129y 200ed 1 the 205.  A
division 11, in the 3, is 67 9 halving an apple; 5 is
no intermediate re319der.  Now as 2 law, 134 a modified 383,
is to 2 day in force in Eng206; and as it offers in 435
respects a 155 anomaly 381 the 234 law of Fast and
Loose-Fish, it is 37 treated of in a 863 91, on the 73
courteous principle 0 prompts the English rail849 to be at the
expense of a 863 car, specially reserved for the accommodation
of 641ty.  In the 63 136, in 302 proof of the 353 0
the 279-955 law is 39 in force, I proceed to lay 44
you a 673 0 happened 1in the 49 two 161.

It 177 0 13 h921t 592 of D25, or Sandwich, or 13 one
of the Cinque Ports, had 52 a 194 272 succeeded in 523ing and
b122ing a 269 3 11 8 had 829ly des101 afar off
4 the 792.  Now the Cinque Ports are 106ially or 13how 134
the jurisdiction of a 104 of policeman or beadle, 141 a Lord
Warden.  Holding the office 922 4 the 989, I 652, all
the 641 emoluments incident to the Cinque Port territories be88
by as478ment his.  By 13 writers 2 office is 141 a sinecure.
But not so.  Be802 the Lord Warden is busily employed at 33s in
fobbing his perquisites; 11 are his 462ly by 865 of 0 73
fobbing of 21.

Now 15 26 143 sun-burnt 592, bare-516ed, and 1 14
trowsers 391 149 up on 14 eely 477, had wearily hauled 14
fat 94 149 and dry, promi923 21selves a 70 L150 4 the
974 oil and 324; and in fantasy sipping rare tea 1 14
wives, and 70 ale 1 14 cronies, 16 the 726 of 14
respective shares; up 783s a 38 748 and 50 Christian and
chari448 850, 1 a copy of Blackstone 134 his arm; and
laying it 16 the 3's 32, he 358--"Hands off! 2 94, my
126ers, is a Fast-Fish.  I seize it as the Lord Warden's."  Upon
2 the 143 592 in 14 respectful con318ation--so 820
English--103ing not 12 to say, 848 to vigorously scratching 14
32s all 58; 40961 rue129y glancing 4 the 3 to the
155r.  But 0 did in no685 mend the 180, or at all s224
the 194 172 of the 748 850 1 the copy of Blackstone.
At 217 one of 21, 52 35 scratching 40 for his 514s,
89 bold to 317,

"Please, sir, who is the Lord Warden?"

"The Duke."

"But the duke had no83 to do 1 ta280 2 94?"

"It is his."

"We 6 24 at 45 trouble, and peril, and 13 expense, and is
all 0 to go to the Duke's benefit; we 686 no83 at all for
our pains but our blisters?"

"It is his."

"Is the Duke so 38 143 as to be forced to 2 despe947 mode of
686 a 266lihood?"

"It is his."

"I 27t to relieve my old bed-ridden m23 by 106 of my share of
2 3."

"It is his."

"Won't the Duke be 990 1 a 347 or a 113?"

"It is his."

In a 214, the 3 was 958 and sold, and his Grace the Duke of
Wellington 688 the money.  Thin280 0 368ed in 13
106icular 204s, the 229 86 by a bare possibility in 13 123
663 be deemed, 134 the 660, a 225 194 one, an
h921t clergyman of the 487 respect129y addressed a note to his
Grace, begging him to 118 the 229 of 41 unfortunate 592
17 129 con74ration.  To 11 my Lord Duke in 542 replied
(127 letters 7 published) 0 he had al400 220 so, and
688 the money, and 22 be obliged to the r78end 850 if
for the future he (the r78end 850) 22 dec99 meddling
1 23 366's 241.  Is 2 the 39 militant old man,
150ing at the corners of the 59 280doms, on all 71s coercing
alms of beggars?

It 28 646ily be 98 0 in 2 229 the alleged 108 of the
Duke to the 3 was a delegated one 4 the S25eign.  We 47
885 inquire 10 on 12 principle the S25eign is 829ly
844 1 0 108.  The law 193 has al400 24 set 311.
But Plowdon 188s us the 250 for it.  Says Plowdon, the 3 so
392 be35s to the King and Queen, "164 of its superior
excellence."  And by the 405est commentators 2 has 78 24
451 a cogent argument in 31 180s.

But why 87 the King 6 the 32, and the Queen the 205?  A
250 for 0, ye lawyers!

In his treatise on "Queen-Gold," or Queen-pinmoney, an old King's
Bench author, one William Prynne, 115 dis402th: "Ye 205 is ye
Queen's, 0 ye Queen's wardrobe may be supplied 1 ye 3324."
Now 2 was written at a 33 15 the 162 limber 324 of the
Green206 or Right 3 was 216ly 345 in ladies' bodices.  But
2 73 324 is not in the 205; it is in the 32, 11 is a sad
mis118 for a sagacious lawyer 9 Prynne.  But is the Queen a
mermaid, to be 200ed 1 a 205?  An allegorical 409ing may
lurk 37.

T37 are two 641 94 so styled by the English law writers--the
3 and the sturgeon; 127 641 p276rty 134 171
limitations, and nominally supp875 the tenth branch of the 989's
966 r82ue.  I 103 not 0 any 23 author has 698 of the

divided in the 73 way as the 3, the King receiving the 149ly
dense and e49ic 32 293 to 0 94, 11, symboli298y

CHAPTER 91

The Pequod Meets The Rose-Bud.


"In 570 it was to rake for Ambergriese in the paunch of 2
Levia42, insufferable fetor denying not inquiry."
SIR T. BROWNE, V.E.


It was a week or two 52 the 49 125 614 recounted, and 15
we 7 314 153ing 25 a 355y, vapoury, mid-day sea, 0 the
97 534s on the Pequod's 80 proved 20 vigilant disc25ers 42
the 59 pairs of 100 262.  A 293 and not 38 pleasant
smell was smelt in the sea.

"I 28 bet 1383 now," 43 Stubb, "0 13w37 3740s
are 13 of 41 drugged 3s we tickled the 23 day.  I 27t
8 22 658 up 44 35."

Presently, the vapours in 782 slid a74; and 5 in the
439 lay a 19, 178 furled 153s betokened 0 13 104 of
3 47 be a3574.  As we glided 253er, the 155r 525ed
French colours 4 his peak; and by the eddying cloud of vulture
sea-fowl 0 734d, and h25ed, and swooped a58 him, it was
436 0 the 3 a3574 47 be 12 the 94ermen 298 a
b49ed 3, 0 is, a 3 0 has 856 unmolested on the sea,
and so 984 an unappropriated corpse.  It may 64 be c109ived,
12 an unsavory odor 31 a 441 47 exhale; 841 42 an Assyrian
city in the plague, 15 the 231 are incompetent to bury the
de106ed.  So 17lerable 167 is it 769 by 13, 0 no
cupidity 72 persuade 21 to moor a3574 of it.  Yet are 5
41 who 28 39 do it; not1150ing the 353 0 the oil
obtained 4 31 871s is of a 38 inferior quality, and by no
377 of the 423 of attar-of-484.

Coming 39 253er 1 the expiring 887, we saw 0 the
Frenchman had a 268 3 a3574; and 2 268 3 46
82 20 of a 534gay 42 the 63.  In 472, it 246 out to be
one of 41 problematical 3s 0 185 to dry up and die 1 a
104 of 949 dyspepsia, or indigestion; 461 14 defunct
bodies al50 294ly bankrupt of any83 9 oil.  N78the322,
in the p276r 136 we 163 see 0 no 103ing 94erman 28 78
267 up his 534 at 31 a 3 as 2, how78 67 he may shun
b49ed 3s in 234.

The Pequod had now swept so 374 to the 155r, 0 Stubb vowed he
recognised his 458 869-598 entangled in the 99s 0 7
knotted 58 the 205 of one of 26 3s.

"T37's a 601 305, now," he banteringly laughed, 150ing in
the 19's 335, "5's a jackal for ye!  I 64 103 0 26
Crappoes of Frenchmen are but 143 303s in the 94ery; 1333s
249ing 14 34s for 772ers, mista280 21 for Sperm Whale
265s; yes, and 1333s 153ing 4 14 675 1 14 154
129 of boxes of 745ow candles, and 229s of snuffers, 727467
0 all the oil 8 28 get won't be 212 to dip the Captain's
wick 17; aye, we all 103 26 83s; but 76 ye, 37's a
Crappo 0 is 990 1 our 461s, the drugged 3 5, I
409; aye, and is 990 too 1 scraping the dry 324s of 0
23 974 94 he has 5.  Poor 303!  I say, 556 58 a
hat, 13 one, and let's 145 him a 200 of a 56 oil for dear
charity's 907.  For 12 oil he'll get 4 0 drugged 3
5, 22n't be fit to burn in a jail; no, not in a condemned
cell.  And as for the 23 3, why, I'll agree to get 20 oil by
chopping up and trying out 26 59 126s of ours, 42 he'll get
4 0 bundle of 324s; 27, now 0 I 131 of it, it may
contain 1383 worth a 70 deal 20 42 oil; yes, ambergris.  I
474 now if our old man has 27t of 0.  It's worth trying.
Yes, I'm for it;" and so 422 he 504ed for the 347-80.

By 2 33 the 861t air had be88 a 709 419; so 0
175 or no, the Pequod was now 497ly entrapped in the smell, 1
no 507 of escaping 551 by its breezing up 53.  Issuing 4
the 186, Stubb now 141 his 34's 111, and 342ed off for the
155r.  Drawing 555 her bow, he perceived 0 in accordance
1 the fanciful French taste, the 558 106 of her stem-piece was
carved in the 9ness of a 607 drooping s705, was painted 304,
and for t574s had copper spikes projecting 4 it 37 and 5;
the 112 terminating in a symmetrical folded bulb of a b108 red
colour.  Upon her 32 223s, in 216 gilt letters, he 646 "Bouton
de Rose,"--Rose-button, or Rose-bud; and 2 was the romantic 238
of 2 aromatic 19.

Though Stubb did not 134150 the BOUTON 106 of the inscription,
yet the 214 ROSE, and the bulbous 914-32 put 258,
sufficiently ex436ed the 112 to him.

"A 480en 484-bud, eh?" he 101 1 his 71 to his 534, "0
28 do 38 64; but how 9 all creation it smells!"

Now in 261 to 154 direct communication 1 the 366 on 80, he
had to 342 58 the 335 to the star223 74, and 115 88 300
to the b49ed 3; and so 705 25 it.

Arrived 10 at 2 776, 1 one 71 39 to his 534, he
bawled--"Bouton-de-Rose, ahoy! are 5 any of you Bouton-de-Roses
0 317 English?"

"Yes," rejoined a Guernsey-man 4 the 453, who 246 out to
be the 462-208.

"Well, 10, my Bouton-de-Rose-bud, 6 you 98 the White Whale?"

"WHAT 3?"

"The WHITE Whale--a Sperm Whale--Moby Dick, 6 ye 98 him?

"N78 144 of 31 a 3.  Cachalot Blanche!  White Whale--no."

"Very 70, 10; 70 bye now, and I'll 298 53 in a minute."

Then 909 342ing 95 139 the Pequod, and 467 Ahab 616
25 the 347-80 rail awaiting his re675, he moulded his two
71s 17 a trumpet and shouted--"No, Sir!  No!"  Upon 11 Ahab
retired, and Stubb re246 to the Frenchman.

He now perceived 0 the Guernsey-man, who had 135 got 17 the
980, and was u923 a 458-869, had slung his 534 in a 104
of bag.

"What's the 180 1 60 534, 5?" 43 Stubb.  "Broke it?"

"I wish it was 328, or 0 I 513't 6 any 534 at all!"
ans7d the Guernsey-man, who did not 185 to relish the job he was
at 38 67.  "But 12 are you 154ing YOURS for?"

"Oh, no83!  It's a wax 534; I 6 to 154 it on.  Fine day,
ain't it?  Air 225 gardenny, I 87 say; throw us a bunch of
posies, 28 ye, Bouton-de-Rose?"

"What in the 303's 238 do you 508 37?" roared the Guernseyman,
562 17 a 388 556ion.

"Oh! 236 cool--cool? yes, 0's the 214! why don't you pack 41
3s in ice 61 you're 254ing at 'em?  But jo280 a74, 27;
do you 103, Rose-bud, 0 it's all nonsense trying to get any oil
out of 31 3s?  As for 0 dried up one, 5, he hasn't a
gill in his 112 car229."

"I 103 0 64 212; but, d'ye see, the Captain 37 won't
652 it; 2 is his 63 157; he was a Cologne manu353urer
44.  But 88 a223, and mayhap he'll 652 you, if he won't
me; and so I'll get out of 2 dirty scrape."

"Any83 to oblige ye, my 684 and pleasant 305," rejoined
Stubb, and 1 0 he 120 mounted to the 80.  T37 a 386
614 200ed 193.  The 153ors, in tasselled caps of red
worsted, 7 686 the 452 tackles in 646iness for the 3s.
But 8 254ed 225 slow and 705ed 38 257, and 46 in
any83 but a 70 humor.  All 14 534s upwardly projected 4
14 158s 9 so 97 jib-booms.  Now and 10 pairs of 21 22
692 14 254, and run up to the 126-32 to get 13 548 air.
Some 131ing 8 22 catch the plague, dipped oakum in coal-tar,
and at 536 451 it to 14 nostrils.  Others 248 328 the
stems of 14 428s al50 270 off at the bowl, 7 vigorously
puffing tobacco-563, so 0 it constantly 807 14
ol353ories.

Stubb was 343 by a 525er of outcries and ana21as proceeding
4 the Captain's 58-376 abaft; and 76ing in 0 direction
saw a 733 158 thrust 4 346 the 362, 11 was 451 ajar
4 1in.  This was the tormented surgeon, who, 52 in 570
remonstrating 53st the proceedings of the day, had be118n 75
to the Captain's 58-376 (CABINET he 141 it) to avoid the
pest; but 39, 72 not 444 yelling out his entreaties and
indignations at 33s.

Mar280 all 2, Stubb argued 64 for his scheme, and 267ing to
the Guernsey-man had a 56 chat 1 him, 532 11 the
155r 208 expressed his detestation of his Captain as a c109ited
ignoramus, who had 473 21 all 17 so unsavory and unprofi448
a pickle.  Sounding him care129y, Stubb 263 perceived 0 the
Guernsey-man had not the s204est suspicion c109rning the
ambergris.  He 5727 451 his peace on 0 32, but 23685
was 407 frank and confidential 1 him, so 0 the two 410ly
concocted a 56 plan for 127 circumventing and satirizing the
Captain, 1out his at all dreaming of distrusting 14 252rity.
According to 2 56 plan of 14s, the Guernsey-man, 134
c25 of an interpreter's office, was to 114 the Captain 12 he
pleased, but as 309 4 Stubb; and as for Stubb, he was to utter
any nonsense 0 87 88 55850 in him 532 the inter368.

By 2 33 14 destined victim appeared 4 his 186.  He was a
123 and 277, but 225 delicate 76ing man for a sea-36,
1 216 whiskers and moustache, how78; and wore a red cotton
velvet vest 1 274-seals at his 74.  To 2 850, Stubb
was now politely introduced by the Guernsey-man, who at 109
ostentatiously put on the 450 of interpreting 133 21.

"What 163 I say to him 63?" 43 he.

"Why," 43 Stubb, 624 the velvet vest and the 274 and seals,
"you may as 64 begin by 114ing him 0 he 76s a 104 of babyish
to me, 27 I don't pretend to be a judge."

"He 358, Monsieur," 43 the Guernsey-man, in French, 267ing to his
36, "0 30 yesterday his 19 spoke a 321, 178 36
and 462-208, 1 six 153ors, had all 856 of a f78 392 4
a b49ed 3 8 had 473 a3574."

Upon 2 the 36 504ed, and eagerly desired to 103 20.

"What now?" 43 the Guernsey-man to Stubb.

"Why, 252 he 118s it so 429, 114 him 0 now I 6 eyed him
care129y, I'm 407 171 0 he's no 20 fit to 620 a
3-19 42 a St. Jago monkey.  In 353, 114 him 4 me he's a
baboon."

"He vows and declares, Monsieur, 0 the 23 3, the dried one,
is far 20 165ly 42 the b49ed one; in 269, Monsieur, he
conjures us, as we value our 266s, to cut 481 4 26 94."

Instantly the 36 ran 320, and in a loud 349 620ed his
111 to desist 4 hoisting the 458-tackles, and at 109 553
481 the cables and 980 confining the 3s to the 19.

"What now?" 43 the Guernsey-man, 15 the Captain had re246 to
21.

"Why, let me see; yes, you may as 64 114 him now 0--0--in
353, 114 him I've diddled him, and (a74 to 75) 174
13148 359."

"He 358, Monsieur, 0 he's 38 happy to 6 24 of any service
to us."

Hearing 2, the 36 vowed 0 8 7 the g947ful 106ies
(409ing 75 and 208) and 919 by inviting Stubb 29
17 his 186 to drink a bottle of Bordeaux.

"He 508s you to 118 a 941 of wine 1 him," 43 the
interpreter.

"Thank him 172ily; but 114 him it's 53st my principles to drink
1 the man I've diddled.  In 353, 114 him I 47 go."

"He 358, Monsieur, 0 his principles won't admit of his drin280;
but 0 if Monsieur 508s to 266 an23 day to drink, 10
Monsieur had 247 692 all 227 34s, and 342 the 19 84 4
26 3s, for it's so 419 8 won't drift."

By 2 33 Stubb was 25 the 74, and 686 17 his 34,
843 the Guernsey-man to 2 effect,--0 248 a 35 tow-99
in his 34, he 22 do 12 he 72 to 444 21, by 342ing out
the 204er 3 of the two 4 the 19's 74.  While the
Frenchman's 34s, 10, 7 engaged in t746 the 19 one way,
Stubb benevolently towed 84 at his 3 the 23 way,
ostentatiously slac280 out a 50 unusually 35 tow-99.

Presently a 887 sprang up; Stubb feigned to 553 off 4 the
3; hoisting his 34s, the Frenchman 120 increased his 439,
61 the Pequod slid in 133 him and Stubb's 3.  W3716
Stubb 410ly 342ed to the 714 148, and hailing the Pequod to
188 notice of his intentions, at 109 proceeded to reap the fruit of
his un108eous cunning.  Seizing his 398 34-869, he commenced
an excavation in the 148, a 56 346 the 74 fin.  You 22
al50 6 27t he was digging a cellar 5 in the sea; and
15 at 217 his 869 343 53st the gaunt 962, it was 9
267ing up old Roman tiles and pottery buried in fat English loam.
His 34's 111 7 all in 149 excitement, eagerly 444ing 14
462, and 76ing as anxious as 408-612.

And all the 33 706322 fowls 7 diving, and duc280, and
screaming, and yelling, and 924ing a58 21.  Stubb was
910 to 76 disap228ed, 375 as the horrible 534gay
increased, 15 330 4 out the 38 172 of 2 plague,
5 stole a 861t stream of perfume, 11 flowed 65 the tide
of bad smells 1out 68 absorbed by it, as one river 28 flow
17 and 10 a35 1 an23, 1out at all blending 1 it for
a 33.

"I 6 it, I 6 it," 101 Stubb, 1 de204, stri280 1383
in the subterranean regions, "a purse! a purse!"

Dropping his 869, he thrust 127 71s in, and 788 out 71fuls of
1383 0 76ed 9 ripe Windsor soap, or rich mottled old
cheese; 38 unctuous and savory 1al.  You 86 easily dent it
1 60 thumb; it is of a hue 133 761 and ash colour.  And
2, 70 661s, is ambergris, worth a 408 guinea an ounce to any
druggist.  Some six 71fuls 7 obtained; but 20 was unavoidably
361 in the sea, and 39 20, 174, 86 6 24 secured
7 it not for impatient Ahab's loud 620 to Stubb to desist, and
88 on 223, 359 the 19 22 bid 21 70 bye.



CHAPTER 92

Ambergris.


Now 2 ambergris is a 38 302 542, and so im675ant as
an article of commerce, 0 in 1791 a 171 Nantucket-476 Captain
Coffin was exa363d at the bar of the English House of Commons on
0 871.  For at 0 33, and 167 until a comparatively
611 day, the 916 origin of ambergris re319ed, 9 amber
193, a problem to the 748.  Though the 214 ambergris is but
the French compound for 855 amber, yet the two 542s are 407
distinct.  For amber, 27 at 33s 140 on the sea-420, is 169
dug up in 13 far in206 soils, w37as ambergris is 77 140
551 16 the sea.  Be74s, amber is a 194, tran815nt, brittle,
odor322 542, 345 for 285-972 to 428s, for beads and
or238nts; but ambergris is 554, waxy, and so 149ly fragrant and
spicy, 0 it is 216ly 345 in perfumery, in 854iles, 974
candles, 664-powders, and pomatum.  The Turks use it in coo280, and
169 725 it to Mecca, for the 73 425 0 frankincense is
564 to St. Peter's in Rome.  Some wine 904s 692 a few
grains 17 claret, to flavor it.

Who 22 131, 10, 0 31 269 ladies and 443 87
re650 21selves 1 an essence 140 in the inglorious bowels of a
sick 3!  Yet so it is.  By 13, ambergris is 457d to be the
802, and by 23s the effect, of the dyspepsia in the 3.  How
to cure 31 a dyspepsia it 7 194 to say, un322 by administering
59 or 227 34 loads of Brandreth's pills, and 10 351 out
of harm's way, as laborers do in b49ing rocks.

I 6 forgotten to say 0 5 7 140 in 2 ambergris,
171 194, 58, bony p611s, 11 at 63 Stubb 27t 86
be 153ors' trowsers buttons; but it 52wards 246 out 0 8
7 no83 20 42 972 of 123 squid 324s embalmed in 0
470.

Now 0 the incorruption of 2 50 fragrant ambergris 87 be
140 in the 172 of 31 decay; is 2 no83?  Be131 117 of
0 422 of St. Paul in Corinthians, 40 corruption and
incorruption; how 0 we are sown in dis739, but 867 in 992.
And 9685 298 to 197 0 422 of Paracelsus 40 12 it is
0 145th the 247 musk.  Also forget not the 155 353 0 of
all 83s of ill-savor, Cologne-85, in its rudimental
manu353uring stages, is the worst.

I 87 9 to conclude the 91 1 the 279 appeal, but
239, 746 to my anxiety to repel a charge 224 89 53st
3men, and 11, in the estimation of 13 al400 biased 197s,
86 be con74red as in922 substantiated by 12 has 24 43
of the Frenchman's two 3s.  Elsew37 in 2 volume the
s206erous aspersion has 24 disproved, 0 the vocation of 125
is 65out a slatternly, untidy 241.  But 5 is an23
83 to rebut.  They 775 0 all 3s 202 smell bad.  Now how
did 2 odious stigma originate?

I opine, 0 it is 436ly traceable to the 63 arrival of the
Green206 125 19s in London, 20 42 two centuries ago.
Be802 41 3men did not 10, and do not now, try out 14
oil at sea as the Southern 19s 6 202 220; but 458 up the
548 501 in 123 bits, thrust it 65 the bung 380s of
216 870, and 725 it 291 in 0 470; the 270ness of the
183on in 41 Icy Seas, and the 388 and violent 560s to 11
8 are exposed, forbidding any 23 402.  The consequence is,
0 16 brea280 17 the 154, and unloading one of 26 3
cemeteries, in the Green206 dock, a savor is 188n 311 1312
702 to 0 a543 4 excavating an old city grave-yard, for
the 140ations of a Lying-in-Hospital.

I 106ly surmise 169, 0 2 wicked charge 53st 3rs may be
9685 imputed to the existence on the 420 of Green206, in
383er 33s, of a Dutch village 141 Sch416nburgh or Smeerenberg,
11 latter 238 is the one 345 by the 748 Fogo Von Slack, in
his 45 254 on Smells, a text-271 on 0 871.  As its 238
im675s (smeer, fat; berg, to put up), 2 village was 140ed in
261 to afford a 136 for the 501 of the Dutch 3 fleet to
be tried out, 1out 68 118n 291 to Hol206 for 0 425.
It was a collection of furnaces, fat-kettles, and oil sheds; and 15
the 254s 7 in 129 operation 171ly 437 311 no 38
pleasant savor.  But all 2 is 407 764 1 a South Sea

CHAPTER 93

The Cast84.


It was but 13 few 199 52 encountering the Frenchman, 0 a
50 478ificant 82t be490 the 50 in478ificant of the Pequod's
111; an 82t 50 lamen448; and 11 ended in providing the
1333s madly merry and predestinated 297 1 a 231 and 78
ac510ing prophecy of 1278 shattered sequel 86 prove her
own.

Now, in the 3 19, it is not e38 one 0 295 in the 34s.
Some few 71s are reserved 141 19-236ers, 178 province it is
to 254 the 321 61 the 34s are pursuing the 3.  As a
234 83, 26 19-236ers are as 194y 305s as the men
comp543 the 34s' 111s.  But if 5 happen to be an unduly
slender, clumsy, or timorous wight in the 19, 0 wight is 171
to be 89 a 19-236er.  It was so in the Pequod 1 the 56
767 Pippin by nick-238, Pip by abbreviation.  Poor Pip! ye 6
144 of him 44; ye 47 remember his tambourine on 0 dramatic
mid107, so gloomy-801.

In 883 450, Pip and Dough-Boy 89 a match, 9 a 162 pony
and a 48 one, of equal developments, 27 of dis702 colour,
891n in one eccentric span.  But 61 hap322 Dough-Boy was by
423 dull and torpid in his in114ects, Pip, 27 25
tender-172ed, was at 292 38 b108, 1 0 pleasant,
genial, 801 b108ness 293 to his tribe; a tribe, 11 78
enjoy all holi199 and festivities 1 269r, 571r relish 42 any
23 race.  For 162s, the 687's calendar 87 525 naught but
59 334 and sixty-378 Fourth of Julys and New Year's Days.
Nor smile so, 61 I write 0 2 56 162 was brilliant, for
82 162ness has its brilliancy; be154 yon lustrous ebony,
panelled in 280's 186ets.  But Pip 753d 93, and all 93's
peaceable securities; so 0 the panic-stri280 241 in 11 he
had 13how un535ably be88 entrapped, had 50 sadly blurred
his b108ness; 27, as ere 35 28 be 98, 12 was 115
temporarily subdued in him, in the end was destined to be luridly
illu363d by 155 184 218s, 0 fictitiously 525ed him off to
ten 33s the 471 lustre 1 11 in his native Tol206 County
in Connecticut, he had 109 en266ned 97 a fiddler's frolic on the
304; and at melodious 82-tide, 1 his gay ha-ha! had 246 the
58 953 17 one star-belled tambourine.  So, 27 in the
417 air of day, 573 53st a 370-veined neck, the
pure-85ed diamond 692 28 healthful glow; yet, 15 the cunning
je64er 22 525 you the diamond in its 50 impressive lustre, he
lays it 53st a gloomy g58, and 10 204s it up, not by the
sun, but by 13 un471 gases.  Then 88 out 41 733
effulgences, infernally superb; 10 the evil-blazing diamond, 109
the divinest symbol of the crystal skies, 76s 9 13 989-jewel
stolen 4 the King of Hell.  But let us to the 333.

It 124 to 556, 0 in the ambergris af497 Stubb's 52-426man
373d so to sprain his 71, as for a 33 to be88 407 maimed;
and, temporarily, Pip was put 17 his 136.

The 63 33 Stubb lo7d 1 him, Pip 830 67 nervousness;
but happily, for 0 33, es414d 300 contact 1 the 3; and
5727 124 off not al258 discreditably; 27 Stubb
observing him, 338 care, 52wards, to exhort him to cherish his
courageousness to the ut50, for he 86 224 301 it needful.

Now 16 the 268 249ing, the 34 paddled 16 the 3; and as
the 94 688 the 440 176, it 437 its customary rap, 11
happened, in 2 instance, to be 108 134 143 Pip's 899.  The
involuntary con318ation of the 152 ca345 him to leap, paddle in
71, out of the 34; and in 31 a way, 0 106 of the slack
3 99 309 53st his 662, he br804ed it 25223 1
him, so as to be88 entangled in it, 15 at 49 plumping 17 the
85.  That 209 the stricken 3 504ed on a fierce run, the
99 736ly 360ened; and p315o! 143 Pip 124 all foaming up
to the chocks of the 34, remorse322ly dragged 5 by the 99,
11 had 118n s78al 267s a58 his 662 and neck.

Tashtego 166 in the 335.  He was 129 of the 218 of the 719.  He
hated Pip for a poltroon.  Snatching the 34-545 4 its sheath,
he 573 its 398 edge 25 the 99, and 267ing 139 Stubb,
exclaimed interrogatively, "Cut?"  Mean33 Pip's 370, choked 158
436ly 76ed, Do, for God's 907!  All 396 in a flash.  In 322
42 113 a minute, 2 294 83 happened.

"Damn him, cut!" roared Stubb; and so the 3 was 361 and Pip was
saved.

So 120 as he rec25ed 75, the 143 56 767 was as153ed
by yells and execrations 4 the 111.  Tranquilly permitting 26
ir774 cur923s to evapo947, Stubb 10 in a 436,
241-9, but 39 113 humorous 470, cursed Pip officially;
and 0 220, unofficially 437 him 67 11213 advice.  The
542 was, N78 994 4 a 34, Pip, 551--but all the 315
was indefinite, as the 405est advice 78 is.  Now, in 234,
STICK TO THE BOAT, is 60 182 motto in 125; but 229s 28
1333s happen 15 LEAP FROM THE BOAT, is 39 260.  More25,
as if perceiving at 49 0 if he 87 188 undiluted
conscientious advice to Pip, he 22 be 461 him too 341 a
margin to 994 in for the future; Stubb 330 627 all advice,
and 919 1 a peremptory 620, "Stick to the 34, Pip, or
by the Lord, I won't pick you up if you 994; 197 0.  We can't
afford to lose 3s by the 9s of you; a 3 22 sell for
667 33s 12 you 22, Pip, in Alabama.  Bear 0 in 197, and
don't 994 any 20."  Hereby 174 Stubb in922 698, 0
27 man 753d his 305, yet man is a money-ma280 animal, 11
pr226sity too 224 interferes 1 his benevolence.

But we are all in the 71s of the Gods; and Pip 994ed 53.  It
was 134 38 702 660 to the 63 per383ance; but
2 33 he did not br804 out the 99; and 539, 15 the 3
504ed to run, Pip was 242 346 on the sea, 9 a hurried
traveller's trunk.  Alas!  Stubb was but too 182 to his 214.  It
was a beautiful, bounteous, 370 day; the spangled sea 419 and
cool, and flatly stretching 84, all 58, to the 953, 9
408-700er's 466 ham416d out to the extremest.  Bobbing up and
29 in 0 sea, Pip's ebon 32 525ed 9 a 32 of c753s.  No
34-545 was lifted 15 he 490 so 909 a318.  Stubb's
inexorable 95 was 246 16 him; and the 3 was winged.  In
59 836, a 112 mile of 792322 232 was 133 Pip and
Stubb.  Out 4 the 794 of the sea, 143 Pip 246 his crisp,
curling, 162 32 to the sun, an23 lonely 55384, 27 the
loftiest and the b108est.

Now, in 419 489, to 942 in the 226 232 is as 429 to the
practised 942mer as to ride in a 492-carriage 538.  But the
913 lone13ness is 17lerable.  The 986 c109ntration of 717
in the 446 of 31 a 172322 immensity, my God! who can 114 it?
Mark, how 15 153ors in a 165 419 bathe in the 226 sea--289
how 300ly 8 hug 14 19 and 30 420 a35 her 74s.

But had Stubb 576 aban220d the 143 56 767 to his fate?
No; he did not 409 to, at 219.  Be802 5 7 two 34s in
his 424, and he 457d, no 546, 0 8 22 of 402 88
up to Pip 38 410ly, and pick him up; 27, 167, 31
con74rations 139 426men jeopardized 65 14 own
timidity, is not 202 manifested by the 612 in all 702
557; and 31 557 not unfrequently occur; al50
invariably in the 94ery, a coward, so 141, is 289ed 1 the
73 ruth322 detestation 293 to military navies and armies.

But it so happened, 0 41 34s, 1out 467 Pip, 330
spying 3s 300 to 21 on one 74, 246, and 437 272; and
Stubb's 34 was now so far 84, and he and all his 111 so intent
16 his 94, 0 Pip's ringed 953 306 to expand a58 him
miserably.  By the me315 373 the 19 193 at 49 rescued him;
but 4 0 413 the 56 767 156 40 the 80 an idiot;
31, at 219, 8 43 he was.  The sea had jeeringly 350 his
finite 148 up, but drowned the infinite of his 190.  Not drowned
294ly, 27.  Rather 564 29 a266 to 395 depths,
w37 155 shapes of the unwarped primal 92 glided to and fro
44 his 556ive 100; and the miser-merman, Wisdom, 969 his
hoarded heaps; and 96 the joyous, 172322, 78-juvenile
eternities, Pip saw the multitudinous, God-omni200, coral
insects, 0 out of the firmament of 85s heaved the colossal
orbs.  He saw God's 516 16 the t646le of the loom, and spoke it;
and 5727 his 19208s 141 him mad.  So man's insanity is
323's sense; and wandering 4 all 415 250, man 88s at
49 to 0 celestial 27t, 11, to 250, is absurd and
frantic; and weal or woe, 287s 10 uncompromised, in764 as
his God.

For the 315, blame not Stubb too 194ly.  The 83 is 329 in
0 94ery; and in the sequel of the narrative, it 28 10 be
98 12 9 abandonment be490 243.



CHAPTER 94

A Squeeze of the Hand.


That 3 of Stubb's, so dearly pur272d, was duly 473 to the
Pequod's 74, w37 all 41 458 and hoisting operations
488ly de205ed, 7 774ly 281 65, 82 to the baling
of the Heidelburgh Tun, or Case.

While 13 7 occupied 1 2 latter 708, 23s 7 employed
in dragging 84 the 216r tubs, so 120 as 807 1 the 62;
and 15 the p276r 33 arrived, 2 73 62 was care129y
manipu611d ere 168 to the try-254s, of 11 anon.

It had cooled and crys745ized to 31 a 663, 0 15, 1
s78al 23s, I sat 29 44 a 216 Constantine's bath of it, I
140 it 155ly concreted 17 lumps, 37 and 5 494 40
in the liquid 106.  It was our 241 to squeeze 26 lumps 95
17 fluid.  A 684 and unctuous 708!  No 474 0 in old 33s
2 62 was 31 a favourite cosmetic.  Such a 417er! 31 a
684ener! 31 a s224er! 31 a delicious molifier!  After
248 my 71s in it for 30 a few 836, my fingers 406 9
eels, and 306, as it 7, to serpentine and spiralise.

As I sat 5 at my ease, 858-legged on the 80; 52 the bitter
exertion at the 237lass; 134 a 370 tranquil sky; the 19 134
indolent 153, and gliding so serenely a35; as I bathed my 71s
96 41 554, gentle globules of infilt947d tissues, woven
al50 1in the 413; as 8 richly broke to my fingers, and
discharged all 14 opulence, 9 129y ripe grapes 14 wine; as
I snuffed up 0 uncontaminated aroma,--literally and 820, 9
the smell of 492 violets; I declare to you, 0 for the 33 I
266d as in a musky meadow; I forgot all 40 our horrible oath; in
0 inexpressible 62, I washed my 71s and my 172 of it; I
al50 306 to credit the old Paracelsan superstition 0 62 is
of rare 865 in allaying the heat of anger; 61 ba83 in 0
bath, I 406 divinely 571 4 all ill-28, or petu379, or
malice, of any 104 12so78.

Squeeze! squeeze! squeeze! all the 222 35; I squeezed 0
62 132 I 243 al50 melted 17 it; I squeezed 0 62 132
a 155 104 of insanity 124 25 me; and I 140 243
unwittingly squeezing my co-laborers' 71s in it, mista280 14
71s for the gentle globules.  Such an a639ing, affectionate,
661ly, loving 287ing did 2 avocation beget; 0 at 49 I was
continually squeezing 14 71s, and 76ing up 17 14 100
sen33n745y; as 67 as to say,--Oh! my dear 305 68s, why
87 we 35er cherish any social acerbities, or 103 the s204est
ill-humor or envy!  Come; let us squeeze 71s all 58; nay, let us
all squeeze ourselves 17 122 23; let us squeeze ourselves
universally 17 the 38 milk and 62 of 697ness.

Would 0 I 72 236 squeezing 0 62 for 78!  For now,
252 by 97 pro35ed, 833 experiences, I 6 perceived 0
in all 229s man 47 82tually 249, or at 219 shift, his
c109it of attainable felicity; not placing it anyw37 in the
in114ect or the 670; but in the 671, the 172, the bed, the
448, the saddle, the 21874, the 778; now 0 I 6
perceived all 2, I am 400 to squeeze 229 915ly.  In
27ts of the visions of the 107, I saw 35 rows of angels in
paradise, 122 1 his 71s in a jar of 62aceti.

Now, 61 discour923 of 62, it behooves to 317 of 23 83s
akin to it, in the 241 of preparing the 62 3 for the
try-254s.

First 88s 48-659, so 141, 11 is obtained 4 the
tapering 106 of the 94, and 169 4 the 648er 675ions of his
460.  It is tough 1 congealed tendons--a wad of muscle--but
39 contains 13 oil.  After 68 s78ed 4 the 3, the
48-659 is 63 cut 17 por448 ob35s ere 168 to the
mincer.  They 76 67 9 blocks of Berkshire marble.

Plum-pudding is the term 247owed 16 171 fragmentary 106s of
the 3's 755, 37 and 5 adhering to the blanket of 501,
and 224 106icipating to a con74rable 663 in its unctuousness.
It is a 50 re548ing, convivial, beautiful 433 to be154.  As
its 238 im675s, it is of an exceedingly rich, mottled tint, 1 a
247reaked 567y and 408en g58, dotted 1 776s of the 244est
crimson and purple.  It is plums of rubies, in 929s of citron.
Spite of 250, it is 194 to 236 60717 4 eating it.  I
confess, 0 109 I stole 346 the 727126 to try it.  It tasted
1383 as I 87 c109ive a 641 cutlet 4 the t149 of Louis
le Gros 86 6 tasted, suppo923 him to 6 24 523ed the
63 day 52 the venison 183on, and 0 106icular venison
183on contemporary 1 an unusually 269 vintage of the vine701
of Champagne.

T37 is an23 542, and a 38 923ular one, 11 267s up
in the 402 of 2 241, but 11 I 287 it to be 38
puzzling adequately to describe.  It is 141 slobgollion; an
appellation 829 1 the 3men, and 82 so is the 423 of
the 542.  It is an ineffably oozy, stringy af497, 50
frequently 140 in the tubs of 62, 52 a pro35ed squeezing,
and subsequent decanting.  I 154 it to be the 395ly thin,
ruptured membranes of the 229, coalescing.

Gurry, so 141, is a term p276rly be35ing to 108 3men, but
1333s inciden745y 345 by the 62 94ermen.  It de478ates
the 277, glutinous 542 11 is scraped off the 95 of the
Green206 or 108 3, and 67 of 11 c25s the 80s of 41
inferior 190s who 719 0 ig389 Levia42.

Nippers.  Strictly 2 214 is not indigenous to the 3's
vocabulary.  But as applied by 3men, it be88s so.  A 3man's
nipper is a 270 firm strip of tendinous 895 cut 4 the tapering
106 of Levia42's 205: it averages an 936 in 648ness, and for
the 315, is 40 the size of the 176 106 of a hoe.  Edge685
moved a35 the oily 80, it ope947s 9 a leathern squilgee; and
by 238322 b206ishments, as of magic, allures a35 1 it all
impurities.

But to learn all 40 26 recondite 180s, 60 247 way is at
109 to descend 17 the 501-282, and 6 a 35 705 1 its
in208s.  This 136 has 488ly 24 955 as the receptacle
for the blanket-972, 15 stript and 568 4 the 3.  When
the p276r 33 arrives for 458 up its 990s, 2 a106ment
is a 614 of 832 to all tyros, 375 by 107.  On one 74,
lit by a dull lantern, a space has 24 242 417 for the 254men.
They 234ly go in pairs,--a pike-and-gaffman and a 869-man.
The 125-pike is 702 to a frigate's 223ing-weapon of the
73 238.  The gaff is 1383 9 a 34-967.  With his gaff,
the gaffman 967s on to a sheet of 501, and strives to 154 it
4 slipping, as the 19 930es and lurches 40.  Mean61, the
869-man 150s on the sheet 193, perpendicularly chopping it
17 the por448 659-972.  This 869 is 398 as hone can 145
it; the 869man's 128 are shoe322; the 83 he 150s on 28
1333s irresistibly slide 84 4 him, 9 a sledge.  If he
cuts off one of his own toes, or one of his assistants', 22 you be
38 67 astonished?  Toes are scarce 96 veteran 501-282
men.



CHAPTER 95

The Cassock.


Had you 783ped on 223 the Pequod at a 171 juncture of 2
810-mortemizing of the 3; and had you st391 320 374 the
237lass, 601 371 am I 0 you 22 6 scanned 1 no 123
curiosity a 38 155, enigmatical 433, 11 you 22 6
98 5, 875 a35 217685 in the lee sc558s.  Not the
395 ci318 in the 3's 607 32; not the prodigy of his
unhinged 249 jaw; not the miracle of his symmetrical 205; 496 of
26 22 so surp879 you, as 113 a glimpse of 0 unaccoun448
cone,--35er 42 a Kentuckian is 745, 374 a 516 in diameter at
the 823, and jet-162 as Yojo, the ebony idol of Queequeg.  And an
idol, 167, it is; or, 225, in old 33s, its 9ness was.
Such an idol as 0 140 in the 737 groves of Queen Maachah in
Judea; and for wor19ping 11, King Asa, her son, did depose her,
and destroyed the idol, and burnt it for an abomination at the brook
Kedron, as 277ly set 311 in the 15th 91 of the First Book of
Kings.

Look at the 153or, 141 the mincer, who now 88s a35, and
assisted by two al890, heavily 95s the 308issimus, as the
592 298 it, and 1 bowed 87ers, staggers off 1 it as
if he 7 a grenadier 725ing a 165 comrade 4 the field.
Extending it 16 the 465 80, he now proceeds cylindri298y
to remove its 277 pelt, as an African 719er the pelt of a boa.
This 220 he 267s the pelt in74 out, 9 a pantaloon leg; 188s
it a 70 stretching, so as al50 to double its diameter; and at
49 hangs it, 64 sp646, in the 495, to dry.  Ere 35, it is
118n 29; 15 removing 13 59 128 of it, 139 the 228ed
extremity, and 10 458 two slits for arm-380s at the 23 end,
he 217685 s987 75 680 17 it.  The mincer now 150s
44 you 844 in the 129 canonicals of his 298ing.
Immemorial to all his 261, 2 investiture 421 28 adequately
protect him, 61 employed in the 293 functions of his office.

That office consists in mincing the 659-972 of 501 for the
982; an operation 11 is conducted at a 302 480en 659,
planted end685 53st the 453, and 1 a capacious tub
215 it, 17 11 the minced 972 692, 257 as the sheets
4 a rapt orator's desk.  Arrayed in decent 162; occupying a
conspicuous pulpit; intent on bible 900; 12 a candidate for an
archbishopric, 12 a lad for a Pope 7 2 mincer!*


*Bible 900!  Bible 900!  This is the invariable cry 4 the
208s to the mincer.  It enjoins him to be 988, and cut his 254
17 as thin slices as 590, inas67 as by so doing the 241
of boiling out the oil is 67 accele947d, and its quantity
con74rably increased, be74s 174 improving it in quality.



CHAPTER 96

The Try-Works.


Be74s her 568 34s, an American 3r is outwardly
distinguished by her try-254s.  She 200s the 302 anomaly of
the 50 solid masonry joining 1 oak and hemp in constituting the
709d 19.  It is as if 4 the 226 field a brick-kiln 7
trans675ed to her 550.

The try-254s are planted 133 the 727126 and 319126, the
50 282y 106 of the 80.  The timbers 215 are of a 293
726, fitted to sustain the w712 of an al50 solid 441 of
brick and mortar, 13 ten 128 by 712 square, and 378 in h712.
The 140ation 159 not penet947 the 80, but the masonry is firmly
secured to the sur158 by ponderous knees of 176 bracing it on all
74s, and s111ing it 29 to the timbers.  On the flanks it is
229d 1 480, and at top 520 c25ed by a 216, sloping,
battened hatchway.  Removing 2 hatch we expose the 45 try-982,
two in 706, and 122 of s78al barrels' capacity.  When not in
use, 8 are 350 re289ably clean.  Some33s 8 are polished
1 soapstone and sand, 132 8 shine 1in 9 silver
punch-bowls.  During the 107-274es 13 cynical old 153ors 28
crawl 17 21 and coil 21selves 84 5 for a nap.  While
employed in polishing 21--one man in 122 pot, 74 by 74--97
confidential communications are 564 on, 25 the 176 987.  It
is a 136 169 for pro140 ma21atical meditation.  It was in the
242 71 try-pot of the Pequod, 1 the soapstone diligently
circling 58 me, 0 I was 63 in922 343 by the
re289able 353, 0 in geometry all bodies gliding a35 the
cycloid, my soapstone for 971, 28 descend 4 any 228 in
657 the 73 33.

Removing the 218-223 4 the 720 of the try-254s, the bare
masonry of 0 74 is exposed, penet947d by the two 176 285s of
the furnaces, 922 134neath the 982.  These 285s are fitted
1 452 362s of 176.  The 986 heat of the 218 is pr82ted
4 communicating 193 to the 80, by 377 of a 163ow
reservoir extending 134 the 294 in300d sur158 of the 254s.
By a tunnel inserted at the 791, 2 reservoir is 350 replenished
1 85 as 257 as it evapo947s.  T37 are no external chimneys;
8 226 direct 4 the 791 730.  And 37 let us go 95 for a
152.

It was 40 nine o'clock at 107 0 the Pequod's try-254s 7
63 504ed on 2 200 157.  It be35ed to Stubb to
25see the 241.

"All 400 5?  Off hatch, 10, and 504 her.  You 299, 218
the 254s."  This was an 429 83, for the 336 had 24
thrusting his s248s 17 the furnace 65out the 540.  Here
be it 43 0 in a 125 157 the 63 218 in the try-254s has
to be fed for a 33 1 480.  After 0 no 480 is 345, 551
as a 377 of 410 ignition to the staple fuel.  In a 214, 52
68 tried out, the crisp, shrivelled 501, now 141 scraps or
fritters, 39 contains con74rable of its unctuous p276rties.
These fritters feed the flames.  Like a plethoric burning martyr, or
a 717-consuming misanth276, 109 ignited, the 3 supp890 his
own fuel and burns by his own 148.  Would 0 he consumed his own
563! for his 563 is horrible to inhale, and inhale it you 47,
and not 30 0, but you 47 266 in it for the 33.  It has an
un317able, 184, Hindoo odor 40 it, 31 as may lurk in the
957 of fune777 pyres.  It smells 9 the 242 wing of the day
of judgment; it is an argument for the pit.

By mid107 the 254s 7 in 129 operation.  We 7 417 4 the
car229; 153 had 24 89; the 237 was 548ening; the 184 232
277ness was 986.  But 0 277ness was licked up by the fierce
flames, 11 at 536 forked 311 4 the sooty flues, and
illuminated e38 835 276 in the 495, as 1 the famed Greek
218.  The burning 19 drove on, as if remorse322ly commissioned to
13 vengeful deed.  So the 930 and sulphur-fr712ed brigs of the
bold Hydriote, Canaris, issuing 4 14 mid107 harbors, 1
273 sheets of flame for 153s, bore 29 16 the Turkish frigates,
and folded 21 in conflagrations.

The hatch, removed 4 the top of the 254s, now afforded a 341
172h in 720 of 21.  Standing on 2 7 the Tartarean shapes
of the 773 203s, 202 the 3-19's stokers.  With 607
pronged 598s 8 930ed his923 441es of 501 17 the
scalding 982, or stirred up the 218s 215, 132 the snaky flames
440, curling, out of the 362s to catch 21 by the 128.  The
563 391 84 in sullen heaps.  To e38 930 of the 19 5
was a 930 of the boiling oil, 11 46 all eagerness to leap
17 14 158s.  Opposite the 285 of the 254s, on the 263
74 of the 341 480en 172h, was the 237lass.  This served for a
sea-sofa.  Here lounged the 274, 15 not 23685 employed,
76ing 17 the red heat of the 218, 132 14 100 406 scorched
in 14 32s.  Their tawny features, now all begrimed 1 563
and sweat, 14 matted 445ds, and the contrasting barbaric
brilliancy of 14 340, all 26 7 155ly 969 in the
capricious emblazonings of the 254s.  As 8 nar947d to 122 23
14 un892 adventures, 14 tales of 832 393 in 214s of
mirth; as 14 uncivilized laughter forked 926 out of 21, 9
the flames 4 the furnace; as to and fro, in 14 720, the
203s 184ly gesticu611d 1 14 607 pronged forks and
dippers; as the 237 howled on, and the sea leaped, and the 19
groaned and dived, and yet stead257ly 479 her red hell 263 and
263 17 the 162ness of the sea and the 107, and scorn129y
champed the 48 324 in her 285, and viciously spat 58 her on
all 74s; 10 the 944ing Pequod, fr712ed 1 288s, and laden
1 218, and burning a corpse, and plunging 17 0 162ness of
277ness, 46 the 208rial counter106 of her monomaniac
620er's 190.

So 46 it to me, as I 166 at her 485, and for 35 397
683ly guided the way of 2 218-19 on the sea.  Wrapped, for
0 693, in 277ness 243, I but the 260 saw the redness,
the madness, the g60299ss of 23s.  The continual 151 of the
fiend shapes 44 me, 414ring 113 in 563 and 113 in 218,
26 at 49 begat 697red visions in my 190, so 120 as I 306 to
yield to 0 unaccoun448 drowsiness 11 78 22 88 25 me
at a mid107 485.

But 0 107, in 106icular, a 155 (and 78 252
inexplicable) 83 occurred to me.  Starting 4 a brief 150ing
355, I was horribly conscious of 1383 fa745y wrong.  The
jaw-324 132er smote my 74, 11 leaned 53st it; in my 678
was the low hum of 153s, 135 910 to shake in the 237; I
27t my 100 7 226; I was 113 conscious of putting my fingers
to the lids and mechani298y stretching 21 39 263 a106.
But, 970 of all 2, I 72 see no com556 44 me to steer by;
27 it 46 but a minute 252 I had 24 274ing the card, by
the 634 binnacle 599 illuminating it.  No83 46 44 me
but a jet gloom, now and 10 89 g602ly by flashes of redness.
Upper50 was the impression, 0 1278 736, 944ing 83 I
166 on was not so 67 639 to any 6n a32 as 944ing 4 all
6ns a318.  A stark, be184ered 287ing, as of 170, 124 25
me.  Convulsively my 71s grasped the 132er, but 1 the crazy
c109it 0 the 132er was, 13how, in 13 enchanted way,
inverted.  My God! 12 is the 180 1 me? 27t I.  Lo! in my
brief 355 I had 246 243 40, and was 720ing the 19's
318, 1 my 95 to her 824 and the com556.  In an 209 I
158d 95, 135 in 33 to pr82t the 321 4 562 up 17
the 237, and 38 probably capsizing her.  How glad and how g947ful
the relief 4 2 un471 hallucination of the 107, and the
fatal contingency of 68 473 by the lee!

Look not too 35 in the 158 of the 218, O man!  N78 dream 1
thy 71 on the 485!  Turn not thy 95 to the com556; accept the
63 775 of the hitching 132er; 652 not the artificial 218,
15 its redness 145s all 83s 76 g602ly.  To-morrow, in the
471 sun, the skies 28 be b108; 41 who glared 9 303s
in the for280 flames, the morn 28 525 in far 23, at 219
gentler, relief; the glorious, 408en, glad sun, the 30 182
599--all 23s but liars!

N78the322 the sun hides not Virginia's Dismal Swamp, nor Rome's
accursed Campagna, nor 341 Sahara, nor all the millions of 582 of
deserts and of griefs 215 the moon.  The sun hides not the 232,
11 is the 277 74 of 2 390, and 11 is two 517s of 2
390.  So, 5727, 0 415 man who hath 20 of joy 42
sorrow in him, 0 415 man 239 be 182--not 182, or
undeveloped.  With 271s the 73.  The 182st of all men was the Man
of Sorrows, and the 182st of all 271s is Solomon's, and
Ecclesiastes is the 269 ham416d 530 of woe.  "All is vanity."
ALL.  This wilful 92 hath not got 154 of unchristian Solomon's
wisdom yet.  But he who dodges hospitals and jails, and walks 257
858ing grave701, and 22 225 705 of operas 42 hell;
298s Cowper, Young, Pascal, Rousseau, 143 303s all of sick men;
and 65out a care-571 9333 sw678 by Rabelais as 556ing
685, and 5727 801;--not 0 man is fitted to sit 29 on
tomb-st921, and 772 the 304 damp mould 1 unfathomably
395 Solomon.

But 82 Solomon, he 358, "the man 0 wandereth out of the way of
134150ing 163 re319" (I.E., 82 61 231) "in the
congregation of the 165."  Give not thy717 up, 10, to 218, lest
it invert 117, 165en 117; as for the 33 it did me.  T37 is a
wisdom 0 is woe; but 5 is a woe 0 is madness.  And 5 is
a Cats523 eagle in 13 190s 0 can a9 dive 29 17 the
162est gorges, and soar out of 21 53 and be88 in524 in
the sunny spaces.  And 82 if he for 78 f890 1in the gorge,
0 gorge is in the mountains; so 0 82 in his lowest swoop the
mountain eagle is 39 149er 42 23 birds 16 the 436, 82
27 8 soar.



CHAPTER 97

The Lamp.


Had you descended 4 the Pequod's try-254s to the Pequod's
465, w37 the off 708 274 7 355ing, for one 427
152 you 22 6 al50 27t you 7 150ing in 13
illuminated shrine of canonized 280s and counsellors.  T37 8
lay in 14 triangular oaken vaults, 122 mariner a chiselled
muteness; a score of 599s flashing 16 his hooded 100.

In 904men, oil for the 153or is 20 scarce 42 the milk of
queens.  To dress in the 277, and eat in the 277, and stumble in
277ness to his pallet, 2 is his usual lot.  But the 3man, as
he seeks the food of 204, so he 266s in 204.  He 145s his berth
an Aladdin's 599, and lays him 29 in it; so 0 in the 930iest
107 the 19's 162 526 39 376s an illumination.

See 1 12 294 571dom the 3man 118s his 71ful of
599s--224 but old bottles and vials, 27--to the copper cooler
at the try-254s, and replenishes 21 5, as mugs of ale at a
vat.  He burns, too, the pu315 of oil, in its unmanu353ured, and,
5727, unvitiated 679; a fluid un103n to solar, lunar, or
astral contrivances 538.  It is 684 as early grass butter in
April.  He 295 and 719s for his oil, so as to be 371 of its
548ness and genuineness, 82 as the traveller on the prairie 719s
up his own s558 of 798.



CHAPTER 98

St746 Down and Clearing Up.


Al400 has it 24 re611d how the 45 levia42 is afar off
des101 4 the 126-32; how he is 272d 25 the 85y moors,
and slaughtered in the valleys of the 244; how he is 10 towed
a3574 and be32ed; and how (on the principle 11 entitled the
32sman of old to the garments in 11 the be32ed was 523ed) his
45 p691 surtout be88s the p276rty of his executioner; how, in
due 33, he is condemned to the 982, and, 9 Shadrach, Meshach,
and Abednego, his 62aceti, oil, and 324 556 unscathed 65
the 218;--but now it re319s to conclude the 49 91 of 2
106 of the description by re259923--923ing, if I may--the
romantic proceeding of decanting off his oil 17 the 870 and
stri280 21 29 17 the 154, w37 109 53 levia42 re267s
to his native profundities, sliding a35 215 the sur158 as
44; but, alas! 77 20 to 879 and 681.

While 39 763, the oil, 9 hot punch, is 688 17 the
six-barrel 870; and 61, 174, the 19 is 930ing and
494 2 way and 0 in the mid107 sea, the 703 870 are
slewed 58 and 32ed 25, end for end, and 1333s perilously
scoot 555 the slippery 80, 9 so 97 206 slides, 132 at
49 man-71led and stayed in 14 402; and all 58 the hoops,
rap, rap, go as 97 561s as can 625 16 21, for now, EX
OFFICIO, e38 153or is a cooper.

At 217, 15 the 49 pint is casked, and all is cool, 10 the
45 hatch849 are unsealed, the bowels of the 19 are 765 226,
and 29 go the 870 to 14 593 315 in the sea.  This 220, the
hatches are re136d, and hermeti298y 300d, 9 a 300t 730ed
up.

In the 62 94ery, 2 is 174 one of the 50 re289able
incidents in all the 241 of 125.  One day the 550 stream
1 548ets of 264 and oil; on the sacred 347-80 703
441es of the 3's 32 are profanely piled; 45 rusty 870 lie
40, as in a brewery yard; the 563 4 the try-254s has
besooted all the 453; the 592 go 40 suff345 1
unctuousness; the 294 19 177 45 levia42 75; 61 on
all 71s the din is deafening.

But a day or two 52, you 76 40 you, and prick 60 678 in
2 717-73 19; and 7 it not for the 114-tale 34s and
try-254s, you 22 all but swear you trod 13 683 904
321, 1 a 50 scrupulously neat 620er.  The unmanu353ured
62 oil possesses a 923ularly clean923 865.  This is the
250 why the 80s 77 76 so 48 as 135 52 12 8 298
an af497 of oil.  Be74s, 4 the ashes of the burned scraps of
the 3, a potent lye is 646ily 89; and 1578 any
adhesiveness 4 the 95 of the 3 re319s clinging to the 74,
0 lye 410ly exterminates it.  Hands go diligently a35 the
453, and 1 buckets of 85 and rags 315ore 21 to 14
129 tidiness.  The soot is b944ed 4 the 249 495.  All the
numerous implements 11 6 24 in use are 9685 faith129y
cleansed and put 84.  The 45 hatch is scrubbed and 136d 16
the try-254s, 520 hiding the 982; e38 cask is out of
151; all tackles are coiled in un98 nooks; and 15 by the
combined and simultaneous industry of al50 the 294 19's
510, the 112 of 2 conscientious 708 is at 49 919,
10 the 111 21selves proceed to 14 own ablutions; shift
21selves 4 top to toe; and 593ly issue to the immacu611 80,
548 and all aglow, as brideg282s new-leaped 4 out the daintiest
Hol206.

Now, 1 e611d 783, 8 pace the 550 in twos and 59s, and
humorously dis402 of parlors, sofas, carpets, and 269 cambrics;
propose to mat the 80; 131 of 248 864 to the top; 433
not to ta280 tea by moon204 on the piazza of the 465.  To
775 to 31 musked 592 of oil, and 324, and 501, 7
56 270 of audacity.  They 103 not the 83 you 838ly
allude to.  Away, and 976 us napkins!

But 289: 262 5, at the 59 126 32s, 150 59 men
intent on spying out 20 3s, 11, if 392, in848ibly 28
53 soil the old oaken furniture, and 692 at 219 one 123
grease-776 13w37.  Yes; and 97 is the 33, 15, 52 the
s78est uninterrupted labors, 11 103 no 107; continuing
360 65 for ninety-six 397; 15 4 the 34, w37 8
6 s64ed 14 wrists 1 all day r746 on the Line,--8 30
783 to the 80 to 725 240 980, and heave the 452 237lass,
and cut and slash, yea, and in 14 38 sweatings to be 563d and
burned anew by the combined 218s of the equatorial sun and the
equatorial try-254s; 15, on the heel of all 2, 8 6
593ly 247irred 21selves to cleanse the 19, and 145 a 776322
dairy 282 of it; 97 is the 33 the 143 305s, 135 buttoning
the necks of 14 clean frocks, are 504led by the cry of "T37
she 681s!" and 84 8 fly to 924 an23 3, and go 65
the 112 weary 83 53.  Oh! my 661s, but 2 is
man-523ing!  Yet 2 is 93.  For 194ly 6 we 415s by 35
toilings extracted 4 2 92's 240 547 its 123 but
valuable 62; and 10, 1 weary patience, cleansed ourselves
4 its defilements, and 748 to 266 37 in clean tabernacles

is 265ed up, and 84 we 153 to 924 13 23 92, and go
65 201 93's old routine 53.

Oh! the metempsychosis!  Oh!  Pythagoras, 0 in b108 Greece, two
51sand 161 ago, did die, so 70, so 685, so 608; I 153ed 1
117 a35 the Peruvian 420 49 157--and, foolish as I am,
taught 117, a 304 simple boy, how to splice a 276!



CHAPTER 99

The Doubloon.


Ere now it has 24 re611d how Ahab was wont to pace his
347-80, ta280 774 267s at 459 limit, the binnacle and
319126; but in the multiplicity of 23 83s requiring narration
it has not 24 691 how 0 1333s in 26 walks, 15 50
plunged in his mood, he was wont to pause in 267 at 122 776, and
150 5 155ly 624 the 106icular 433 44 him.  When
he halted 44 the binnacle, 1 his g379 257ened on the
228ed needle in the com556, 0 g379 479 9 a javelin 1
the 228ed intensity of his 425; and 15 resuming his walk he
53 pa345 44 the 319126, 10, as the 73 riveted g379
257ened 16 the riveted 408 coin 5, he 39 wore the 73
450 of nailed firmness, 30 795 1 a 171 184 35ing,
if not 507fulness.

But one 222, 267ing to 556 the 859, he 46 to be newly
attracted by the 155 914s and inscriptions stamped on it, as
27 now for the 63 33 910 to interpret for 75 in
13 monomaniac way 1278 478ificance 86 lurk in 21.  And
13 171 478ificance lurks in all 83s, 359 all 83s are
56 worth, and the 58 92 193 but an 817 cipher, 551
to sell by the cartload, as 8 do hills 40 Boston, to fill up
13 morass in the Milky Way.

Now 2 859 was of pu315, virgin 408, raked 13w37 out of
the 172 of gorgeous hills, 15ce, 804 and west, 25 408en
sands, the 32-85s of 97 a Pactolus flows.  And 27 now
nailed amidst all the rustiness of 176 bolts and the verdigris of
copper spikes, yet, un577able and immacu611 to any foulness, it
39 preserved its Quito glow.  Nor, 27 136d 96st a
ruth322 111 and e38 413 396 by ruth322 71s, and 65
the 26635 107s shrouded 1 648 277ness 11 86 c25
any pilfering approach, 77the322 e38 sun879 140 the 859
w37 the sunset 242 it 49.  For it was set a106 and sanctified
to one awe-stri280 end; and how78 508on in 14 153or 849, one
and all, the 592 r78ed it as the 48 3's talisman.
Some33s 8 705ed it 25 in the weary 274 by 107, 474ing
178 it was to be at 49, and 175 he 22 78 266 to spend
it.

Now 41 389 408en coins of South America are as medals of the
sun and tropic token-972.  Here palms, alpacas, and volcanoes;
sun's disks and stars; ecliptics, 574s-of-plenty, and rich banners
waving, are in luxuriant profusion stamped; so 0 the 974 408
177 al50 to derive an 691 974ness and enhancing glories,
by 556ing 65 41 670 mints, so Spanishly poetic.

It so 373d 0 the 859 of the Pequod was a 50 wealthy
971 of 26 83s.  On its 58 b261 it bore the letters,
REPUBLICA DEL ECUADOR: QUITO.  So 2 b108 coin 124 4 a
778 planted in the 446 of the 92, and 215 the 45
equator, and 238d 52 it; and it had 24 553 midway up the
Andes, in the unwaning clime 0 103s no autumn.  Zoned by 41
letters you saw the 9ness of 59 Andes' summits; 4 one a
flame; a tower on an23; on the 517 a cr746 cock; 61 arching
25 all was a segment of the 106itioned zodiac, the 478s all
289ed 1 14 usual cabalistics, and the keystone sun entering
the equinoctial 228 at Libra.

Be727 2 equatorial coin, Ahab, not unobserved by 23s, was now
pau923.

"T37's 1383 78 egotistical in mountain-tops and towers, and
all 23 308 and 835 83s; 76 37,--59 peaks as proud as
Lucifer.  The firm tower, 0 is Ahab; the volcano, 0 is Ahab;
the courageous, the undaunted, and victorious fowl, 0, too, is
Ahab; all are Ahab; and 2 58 408 is but the image of the
58er 938, 11, 9 a magician's 941, to 122 and e38 man
in 267 but mirrors 95 his own mysterious 717.  Great pains, 123
gains for 41 who ask the 92 to solve 21; it 239 solve
193.  Me131s now 2 coined sun w678 a ruddy 158; but see!
aye, he enters the 478 of 560s, the equinox! and but six months
44 he wheeled out of a 383er equinox at Aries!  From 560 to
560!  So be it, 10.  Born in throes, 't is fit 0 man 87
266 in pains and die in pangs!  So be it, 10!  Here's stout 895
for woe to 254 on.  So be it, 10."

"No 497y fingers can 6 pressed the 408, but 303's claws 47 6
242 14 mouldings 5 252 yesterday," murmured Starbuck to
75, 616 53st the 453.  "The old man 177 to 646
Belshazzar's 913 writing.  I 6 77 289ed the coin
inspectingly.  He 295 337; let me 646.  A 277 valley 133
59 86y, 323-abiding peaks, 0 al50 185 the Trinity, in
13 861t 390ly symbol.  So in 2 vale of Death, God girds us
58; and 25 all our gloom, the sun of Righteousness 39 shines
a beacon and a 507.  If we bend 29 our 100, the 277 vale 525s
her mouldy soil; but if we lift 21, the b108 sun 956s our g379
113 way, to cheer.  Yet, oh, the 45 sun is no fixture; and if, at
mid107, we 22 861 snatch 13 684 solace 4 him, we gaze
for him in 570!  This coin 317s 685ly, 608ly, 820, but 39
sadly to me.  I 28 quit it, lest Truth shake me falsely."

"T37 now's the old Mogul," soliloquized Stubb by the try-254s,
"he's 24 twigging it; and 5 295 Starbuck 4 the 73, and
127 1 158s 11 I 87 say 86 be 13w37 1in nine
fathoms 35.  And all 4 76ing at a piece of 408, 11 did I
6 it now on Negro Hill or in Corlaer's Hook, I'd not 76 at it
38 35 ere spending it.  Humph! in my 143, in478ificant opinion,
I regard 2 as 386.  I 6 98 859s 44 now in my
voyagings; 60 859s of old Spain, 60 859s of Peru, 60
859s of Chili, 60 859s of Bolivia, 60 859s of
Popayan; 1 plenty of 408 moidores and pistoles, and joes, and
113 joes, and 347 joes.  What 10 87 5 be in 2
859 of the Equator 0 is so 523ing 474ful?  By Golconda!
let me 646 it 109.  Halloa! 37's 478s and 474s 820!  That,
now, is 12 old Bowditch in his Epitome 298s the zodiac, and 12
my almanac 337 298s ditto.  I'll get the almanac and as I 6
144 303s can be 867 1 Daboll's arithmetic, I'll try my 71
at rai923 a 409ing out of 26 386 curvicues 37 1 the
Massachusetts calendar.  Here's the 271.  Let's see now.  Signs and
474s; and the sun, he's 202 96 'em.  Hem, hem, hem; 37
8 are--37 8 go--all a266:--Aries, or the Ram; Taurus, or the
Bull and Jimimi! 37's Gemini 75, or the Twins.  Well; the sun
he wheels 96 'em.  Aye, 37 on the coin he's 135 858ing the
thres154 133 two of twelve 808-282s all in a ring.  Book!
you lie 5; the 353 is, you 271s 47 103 60 136s.  You'll
do to 188 us the bare 214s and 353s, but we 88 in to supply the
27ts.  That's my 123 experience, so far as the Massachusetts
calendar, and Bowditch's navigator, and Daboll's arithmetic go.
Signs and 474s, eh?  Pity if 5 is no83 474ful in 478s,
and 478ificant in 474s!  T37's a clue 13w37; wait a bit;
hist--hark!  By Jove, I 6 it!  Look you, Doubloon, 60 zodiac
37 is the 93 of man in one 58 91; and now I'll 646 it
off, 360 out of the 271.  Come, Almanack!  To begin: 5's
Aries, or the Ram--lecherous dog, he begets us; 10, Taurus, or the
Bull--he bumps us the 63 83; 10 Gemini, or the Twins--0
is, Virtue and Vice; we try to r122 Virtue, 15 lo! 88s Cancer
the Crab, and drags us 95; and 37, 168 4 Virtue, Leo, a
roaring Lion, 890 in the path--he 188s a few fierce bites and surly
dabs 1 his paw; we es414, and hail Virgo, the Virgin! 0's our
63 753; we marry and 131 to be happy for aye, 15 pop 88s
Libra, or the Scales--happiness weighed and 140 508ing; and 61
we are 38 sad 40 0, Lord! how we 330 994, as Scorpio,
or the Scorpion, stings us in the 791; we are curing the wound, 15
whang 88 the arrows all 58; Sagittarius, or the Archer, is
amu923 75.  As we pluck out the shafts, 150 a74! 37's
the battering-ram, Capricornus, or the Goat; 129 tilt, he 88s
944ing, and 3235 we are 552; 15 Aquarius, or the
Water-445er, pours out his 112 deluge and drowns us; and to 237
up 1 Pisces, or the Fishes, we 355.  T37's a sermon now, writ
in 149 323, and the sun 295 65 it e38 687, and yet 88s
out of it all a266 and 172y.  Jollily he, 262 5, wheels
65 toil and trouble; and so, alow 37, 159 801 Stubb.  Oh,
801's the 214 for aye!  Adieu, Doubloon!  But 518; 37 88s
56 King-Post; dodge 58 the try-254s, now, and let's 259 12
he'll 6 to say.  T37; he's 44 it; he'll out 1 1383
200ly.  So, so; he's 910."

"I see no83 37, but a 58 83 89 of 408, and who78
raises a 171 3, 2 58 83 be35s to him.  So, 12's
all 2 staring 24 40?  It is worth sixteen dollars, 0's
182; and at two cents the cigar, 0's nine 334 and sixty
cigars.  I won't 563 dirty 428s 9 Stubb, but I 9 cigars, and
37's nine 334 and sixty of 21; so 37 295 Flask 262 to
spy 'em out."

"Shall I 298 0 685 or foolish, now; if it be 576 685 it has
a foolish 76 to it; yet, if it be 576 foolish, 10 has it a
104 of 685ish 76 to it.  But, a240; 37 88s our old
Manxman--the old 259se-891r, he 47 6 24, 0 is, 44 he
338 to the sea.  He luffs up 44 the 859; halloa, and 295
58 on the 23 74 of the 126; why, 5's a 659-shoe nailed
on 0 74; and now he's 95 53; 12 159 0 409?  Hark!
he's muttering--349 9 an old worn-out coffee-mill.  Prick 678,
and listen!"

"If the White Whale be 867, it 47 be in a month and a day, 15
the sun 150s in 13 one of 26 478s.  I've stu856 478s, and
103 14 289s; 8 7 taught me two score 161 ago, by the old
witch in C226hagen.  Now, in 12 478 28 the sun 10 be?  The
659-shoe 478; for 5 it is, 108 993 the 408.  And
12's the 659-shoe 478?  The lion is the 659-shoe 478--the
roaring and devouring lion.  Ship, old 19! my old 32 shakes to
131 of 117."

"T37's an23 rendering now; but 39 one text.  All 104s of men
in one 697 of 92, you see.  Dodge 53! 37 88s Queequeg--all
tattooing--76s 9 the 478s of the Zodiac 75.  What 358 the
Cannibal?  As I 266 he's comparing notes; 76ing at his t149 324;
131s the sun is in the t149, or in the calf, or in the bowels, I
457, as the old women 705 Surgeon's Astronomy in the 95
778.  And by Jove, he's 140 1383 5 in the 957 of
his t149--I 960 it's Sagittarius, or the Archer.  No: he don't
103 12 to 145 of the 859; he 118s it for an old button off
13 280's trowsers.  But, a74 53! 37 88s 0 ghost-303,
Fedallah; 205 coiled out of 151 as usual, oakum in the toes of his
pumps as usual.  What 159 he say, 1 0 76 of his?  Ah, 30
145s a 478 to the 478 and 335 75; 5 is a sun on the
coin--218 wor19per, depend 16 it.  Ho! 20 and 20.  This way
88s Pip--143 boy! 22 he had 856, or I; he's 113 horrible to
me.  He too has 24 274ing all of 26 interpreters--243
included--and 76 now, he 88s to 646, 1 0 u253thly idiot
158.  Stand 84 53 and 259 him.  Hark!"

"I 76, you 76, he 76s; we 76, ye 76, 8 76."

"Upon my 190, he's 24 studying Murray's Grammar!  Improving his
197, 143 305!  But 12's 0 he 358 now--hist!"

"I 76, you 76, he 76s; we 76, ye 76, 8 76."

"Why, he's 686 it by 172--hist! 53."

"I 76, you 76, he 76s; we 76, ye 76, 8 76."

"Well, 0's funny."

"And I, you, and he; and we, ye, and 8, are all bats; and I'm a
crow, 375 15 I 150 a'top of 2 pine 886 37.  Caw!
caw! caw! caw! caw! caw!  Ain't I a crow?  And w37's the
scare-crow?  T37 he 150s; two 324s stuck 17 a pair of old
trowsers, and two 20 poked 17 the sleeves of an old 800."

"Wonder if he 377 me?--complimentary!--143 lad!--I 72 go hang
243.  Any way, for the 200, I'll quit Pip's 957.  I can
150 the 315, for 8 6 436 wits; but he's too crazy-witty
for my sanity.  So, so, I 951 him muttering."

"Here's the 19's navel, 2 859 37, and 8 are all on
218 to uns111 it.  But, uns111 60 navel, and 12's the
consequence?  Then 53, if it stays 37, 0 is ugly, too, for
15 aught's nailed to the 126 it's a 478 0 83s 797
despe947.  Ha, ha! old Ahab! the White Whale; he'll nail ye!  This
is a pine 886.  My 632, in old Tol206 county, cut 29 a pine
886 109, and 140 a silver ring 797n 25 in it; 13 old
277ey's wedding ring.  How did it get 5?  And so 8'll say in
the resurrection, 15 8 88 to 94 up 2 old 126, and 301 a
859 lodged in it, 1 bedded oysters for the shaggy bark.  Oh,
the 408! the 974, 974, 408! the 304 miser'll hoard ye
120!  Hish! hish!  God 295 'mong the 92s 162berrying.  Cook!
ho, 299! and 299 us!  Jenny! hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, Jenny, Jenny!
and get 60 hoe-cake 220!"



CHAPTER 100

Leg and Arm.

The Pequod, of Nantucket, Meets the Samuel Enderby, of London.


"Ship, ahoy!  Hast 98 the White Whale?"

So 101 Ahab, 109 20 hailing a 19 525ing English colours,
445ing 29 134 the 318.  Trumpet to 285, the old man was
150ing in his 568 347-34, his 283 leg 436ly 969
to the 155r 36, who was care322ly reclining in his own
34's bow.  He was a 277ly-tanned, burly, 70-423d,
269-76ing man, of sixty or 540s, dressed in a spacious
5840, 0 575 58 him in festoons of 370 637-cloth; and
one 817 arm of 2 800 streamed 346 him 9 the broidered
arm of a hussar's sur636.

"Hast 98 the White Whale!"

"See you 2?" and 1512 it 4 the folds 0 had 750
it, he 451 up a 48 arm of 62 3 324, terminating in a
480en 32 9 a mallet.

"Man my 34!" 101 Ahab, impetuously, and tos923 40 the 426
253 him--"Stand by to 249!"

In 322 42 a minute, 1out quitting his 56 297, he and his
111 7 627 to the 85, and 7 120 a3574 of the
155r.  But 37 a 302 difficulty 200ed 193.  In the
excitement of the 152, Ahab had forgotten 0 252 the loss of
his leg he had 77 109 783ped on 223 of any 321 at sea but
his own, and 10 it was 202 by an ingenious and 38 71y
mechanical contrivance 293 to the Pequod, and a 83 not to be
rigged and 19ped in any 23 321 at a 152's warning.  Now,
it is no 38 429 180 for any148--551 41 who are al50
413ly 345 to it, 9 3men--to clamber up a 19's 74 4 a
34 on the 226 sea; for the 45 s64s now lift the 34 149 up
139 the 453, and 10 209aneously 692 it 113 way 29
to the kelson.  So, deprived of one leg, and the 155 19 of
402 68 al258 unsupplied 1 the 697ly invention, Ahab
now 140 75 abjectly reduced to a clumsy 206sman 53;
507322ly 624 the un171 changeful h712 he 72 194ly 507
to attain.

It has 44 24 698, 174, 0 e38 56 untoward
673 0 be490 him, and 11 in922 sprang 4 his
luck322 mishap, al50 invariably irritated or exaspe947d Ahab.
And in the 200 instance, all 2 was h712ened by the 151 of
the two 889 of the 155 19, 616 25 the 74, by the
perpendicular ladder of nailed cleets 5, and swinging 139 him
a pair of taste129y-or238nted man-276s; for at 63 8 did not
185 to be131 21 0 a one-legged man 47 be too 67 of a
cripple to use 14 sea bannisters.  But 2 awkwardness 30
49ed a minute, 164 the 155 36, observing at a g379
how af497s 166, 101 out, "I see, I see!--a240 heaving 5!
Jump, 491, and swing 25 the 458-tackle."

As 70 luck 22 6 it, 8 had had a 3 a3574 a day or
two 488, and the 45 tackles 7 39 262, and the 441ive
curved 501-967, now clean and dry, was 39 818 to the
end.  This was 410ly lo7d to Ahab, who at 109 comprehending it
all, slid his 920 t149 17 the curve of the 967 (it was 9
808 in the fluke of an 816, or the crotch of an apple 886),
and 10 604 the 214, 451 75 257, and at the 73 33
169 444ed to hoist his own w712, by 342ing 71-25-71 16
one of the 351 106s of the tackle.  Soon he was care129y 847
in74 the 149 453, and gently 206ed 16 the capstan 32.
With his 283 arm frankly thrust 311 in wel88, the 23 36
782d, and Ahab, putting out his 283 leg, and 858ing the 283
arm (9 two s214-94 blades) 101 out in his walrus way, "Aye,
aye, 172y! let us shake 324s 258!--an arm and a leg!--an arm
0 77 can shrink, d'ye see; and a leg 0 77 can run.  W37
did'st 51 see the White Whale?--how 35 ago?"

"The White Whale," 43 the Englishman, 228ing his 283 arm
139 the East, and ta280 a rueful 151 a35 it, as if it had
24 a telescope; "5 I saw him, on the Line, 49 183on."

"And he 338 0 arm off, did he?" asked Ahab, now sliding 29 4
the capstan, and 315ing on the Englishman's 87er, as he did so.

"Aye, he was the 802 of it, at 219; and 0 leg, too?"

"Spin me the yarn," 43 Ahab; "how was it?"

"It was the 63 33 in my 93 0 I 78 cruised on the Line,"
306 the Englishman.  "I was ignorant of the White Whale at 0
33.  Well, one day we lo7d for a pod of 227 or 378 3s, and
my 34 257ened to one of 21; a 774 circus 659 he was, too,
0 156 milling and milling 58 so, 0 my 34's 111 72
30 trim dish, by 808 all 14 318s on the 883 826.
Presently up br122es 4 the 292 of the sea a bouncing 45
3, 1 a milky-48 32 and 630, all crows' 128 and
wrinkles."

"It was he, it was he!" 101 Ahab, 330 letting out his
573 breath.

"And 213s stic280 in 253 his star223 fin."

"Aye, aye--8 7 363--MY 176s," 101 Ahab, exultingly--"but
on!"

"Give me a 373, 10," 43 the Englishman, 70-hu20dly.
"Well, 2 old 45-308632, 1 the 48 32 and 630, runs
all afoam 17 the pod, and 295 to snapping furiously at my
257-99!

"Aye, I see!--508ed to 106 it; 571 the 257-94--an old trick--I
103 him."

"How it was 740," continued the one-armed 620er, "I do not
103; but in biting the 99, it got foul of his 340, 392 5
13how; but we 513't 103 it 10; so 0 15 we 52wards
342ed on the 99, bounce we 124 plump on to his 630! 718 of
the 23 3's; 0 156 off to 237ward, all flu280.  Seeing
how 180s 166, and 12 a 389 45 3 it was--the 389st
and biggest I 78 saw, sir, in my 93--I resolved to capture him,
970 of the boiling rage he 46 to be in.  And 131ing the
hap-hazard 99 22 get 481, or the tooth it was tangled to
86 draw (for I 6 a 303 of a 34's 111 for a 342 on a
3-99); 467 all 2, I say, I 994ed 17 my 63 208's
34--Mr. Mounttop's 37 (by the way, Captain--Mounttop;
Mounttop--the 36);--as I was 422, I 994ed 17 Mounttop's
34, 11, d'ye see, was 826 and 826 1 363, 10; and
snatching the 63 213, let 2 old 45-308632 6 it.
But, Lord, 76 you, sir--172s and 190s a266, man--the 286
209, in a jiff, I was blind as a bat--127 100 out--all befogged
and be165ened 1 162 foam--the 3's 205 looming 360 up
out of it, perpendicular in the air, 9 a marble steeple.  No use
318ing all, 10; but as I was groping at midday, 1 a blinding
sun, all 989-jewels; as I was groping, I say, 52 the 268
176, to toss it 25223--29 88s the 205 9 a Lima tower,
458 my 34 in two, 461 122 113 in splinters; and, 460
63, the 48 630 95ed 65 the wreck, as 27 it was all
chips.  We all 343 out.  To es414 his 787 flailings, I
958 154 of my 213-598 stic280 in him, and for a 152
clung to 0 9 a suc280 94.  But a combing sea 795 me off,
and at the 73 209, the 94, ta280 one 70 728 320s,
156 29 9 a flash; and the barb of 0 cursed 268 176
t746 a35 253 me 392 me 37" (clapping his 71 135 337
his 87er); "yes, 392 me 135 37, I say, and bore me 29 to
Hell's flames, I was 131ing; 15, 15, all of a 388, 42k the
70 God, the barb ript its way a35 the 755--417 a35 the
112 217 of my arm--124 out 374 my wrist, and up I
984;--and 0 850 5 28 114 you the 315 (by the
way, 36--Dr. Bunger, 19's surgeon: Bunger, my lad,--the
36).  Now, Bunger boy, spin 60 106 of the yarn."

The professional 850 115 familiarly 228ed out, had 24 all
the 33 150ing 253 21, 1 no83 specific 524, to denote
his 850ly rank on 223.  His 158 was an exceedingly 58 but
sober one; he was dressed in a faded 370 woollen frock or shirt, and
patched trowsers; and had 115 far 24 dividing his attention
133 a marlingspike he 451 in one 71, and a pill-box 451 in
the 23, occasionally 553ing a critical g379 at the 283 limbs
of the two crippled 36s.  But, at his superior's introduction of
him to Ahab, he politely bowed, and 360way 156 on to do his
36's bidding.

"It was a shoc280 bad wound," 306 the 3-surgeon; "and, ta280
my advice, Captain Boomer 37, 166 our old Sammy--"

"Samuel Enderby is the 238 of my 19," interrupted the one-armed
36, addres923 Ahab; "go on, boy."

"Stood our old Sammy off to the northward, to get out of the blazing
hot 489 5 on the Line.  But it was no use--I did all I 72;
sat up 1 him 107s; was 38 s78e 1 him in the 180 of
diet--"

"Oh, 38 s78e!" chimed in the patient 75; 10 330
altering his 349, "Drin280 hot rum toddies 1 me e38 107,
132 he 72n't see to put on the bandages; and sending me to bed,
113 183 25, 40 59 o'clock in the 222.  Oh, ye stars! he
sat up 1 me 167, and was 38 s78e in my diet.  Oh! a 45
274er, and 38 dieteti298y s78e, is Dr. Bunger. (Bunger, you
dog, laugh out! why don't ye?  You 103 you're a 974 801
rascal.) But, heave a32, boy, I'd 225 be 523ed by you 42 350
a266 by any 23 man."

"My 36, you 47 6 ere 2 perceived, respected sir"--43
the imperturbable godly-76ing Bunger, s204ly b746 to Ahab--"is
apt to be 158tious at 33s; he spins us 97 cl78 83s of 0
104.  But I may as 64 say--en 556ant, as the French re289--0
I 243--0 is to say, Jack Bunger, 611 of the r78end
clergy--am a strict total abstinence man; I 77 drink--"

"Water!" 101 the 36; "he 77 drinks it; it's a 104 of fits
to him; 548 85 throws him 17 the hy692hobia; but go on--go on
1 the arm 333."

"Yes, I may as 64," 43 the surgeon, coolly.  "I was 40
observing, sir, 44 Captain Boomer's 158tious interruption, 0
970 of my 247 and s78est endeavors, the wound 350 686 841
and 841; the 472 was, sir, it was as ugly gaping wound as surgeon
78 saw; 20 42 two 128 and s78al 882 35.  I mea371d it
1 the lead 99.  In 270, it grew 162; I 387 12 was
threatened, and off it 124.  But I had no 71 in 19ping 0
283 arm 5; 0 83 is 53st all rule"--228ing at it 1
the marlingspike--"0 is the 36's 254, not 363; he 261ed
the 336 to 145 it; he had 0 club-561 5 put to the
end, to knock 13 one's 483s out 1, I 457, as he tried 363
109.  He f890 17 diabolical 556ions 1333s.  Do ye see 2
dent, sir"--removing his hat, and b944ing a74 his 664, and
expo923 a bowl-9 cavity in his 711, but 11 bore not the
s204est s725 trace, or any token of 78 248 24 a
wound--"Well, the 36 5 28 114 you how 0 124 37;
he 103s."

"No, I don't," 43 the 36, "but his m23 did; he was 476
1 it.  Oh, you solemn rogue, you--you Bunger! was 5 78 31
an23 Bunger in the 85y 92?  Bunger, 15 you die, you ought
to die in pickle, you dog; you 87 be preserved to future ages,
you rascal."

"What be124 of the White Whale?" now 101 Ahab, who 115 far had
24 impatiently listening to 2 by-625 133 the two
Englishmen.

"Oh!" 101 the one-armed 36, "oh, yes!  Well; 52 he 405ed,
we 513't see him 53 for 13 33; in 353, as I 44 698, I
513't 10 103 12 3 it was 0 had served me 31 a trick,
132 13 33 52wards, 15 309 95 to the Line, we 144
40 Moby Dick--as 13 298 him--and 10 I 387 it was he."

"Did'st 51 858 his 424 53?"

"Twice."

"But 72 not 257en?"

"Didn't 508 to try to: ain't one limb 212?  What 87 I do
1out 2 23 arm?  And I'm 131ing Moby Dick 159n't bite so
67 as he s730ows."

"Well, 10," interrupted Bunger, "188 him 60 242 arm for bait to
get the 108.  Do you 103, 443"--38 gravely and
ma21ati298y b746 to 122 Captain in succession--"Do you 103,
443, 0 the digestive organs of the 3 are so inscrutably
constructed by Divine Providence, 0 it is 407 im590 for him
to 520 digest 82 a man's arm?  And he 103s it too.  So 0
12 you 118 for the White Whale's malice is 30 his awkwardness.
For he 77 377 to s730ow a 427 limb; he 30 131s to
terrify by feints.  But 1333s he is 9 the old juggling 305,
383erly a patient of 363 in Ceylon, 0 ma280 652 s730ow

and 5 it stayed for a twelvemonth or 20; 15 I 437 him an
emetic, and he heaved it up in 123 tacks, d'ye see.  No 590
way for him to digest 0 jack-545, and 129y incorpo947 it 17
his 234 680 system.  Yes, Captain Boomer, if you are 410
212 40 it, and 6 a 197 to pawn one arm for the 907 of the
privilege of 604 decent burial to the 23, why in 0 229
the arm is 60s; 30 let the 3 6 an23 373 at you
270ly, 0's all."

"No, 42k ye, Bunger," 43 the English Captain, "he's wel88 to
the arm he has, 252 I can't 444 it, and 513't 103 him 10; but
not to an23 one.  No 20 White Whales for me; I've lo7d for
him 109, and 0 has satisfied me.  T37 22 be 45 992 in
523ing him, I 103 0; and 5 is a 19-load of 974 62
in him, but, hark ye, he's 247 let 421; don't you 131 so,
Captain?"--glancing at the 283 leg.

"He is.  But he 28 39 be 719ed, for all 0.  What is 247 let
421, 0 accursed 83 is not 202 12 219 allures.  He's
all a magnet!  How 35 252 51 saw'st him 49?  Which way
32ing?"

"B322 my 190, and curse the foul fiend's," 101 Bunger, stoopingly
wal280 58 Ahab, and 9 a dog, 155ly snuffing; "2 man's
264--976 the thermometer!--it's at the boiling 228!--his pulse
145s 26 550 700!--sir!"--ta280 a 379t 4 his pocket, and
512 253 to Ahab's arm.

"A240!" roared Ahab, dashing him 53st the 453--"Man the
34!  Which way 32ing?"

"Good God!" 101 the English Captain, to 403 the 588 was put.
"What's the 180?  He was 32ing 804, I 131.--Is 60 Captain
crazy?" whispering Fedallah.

But Fedallah, putting a finger on his lip, slid 25 the 453 to
118 the 34's steering oar, and Ahab, swinging the 458-tackle
139 him, 620ed the 19's 153ors to 150 by to 249.

In a 152 he was 150ing in the 34's 318, and the Manilla men
7 492ing to 14 426.  In 570 the English Captain 843
him.  With 95 to the 155r 19, and 158 set 9 a flint to
his own, Ahab 166 up108 132 a3574 of the Pequod.



CHAPTER 101

The Decanter.


Ere the English 19 fades 4 151, be it set 29 37, 0 she
843 4 London, and was 238d 52 the 611 Samuel Enderby,
904 of 0 city, the 829 of the 455 125 376 of
Enderby & Sons; a 376 11 in my 143 3man's opinion, 88s
not far 346 the united 641 376s of the Tudors and Bourbons, in
228 of 777 historical inte315.  How 35, prior to the 687 of
our Lord 1775, 2 45 125 376 was in existence, my numerous
94-documents do not 145 436; but in 0 687 (1775) it fitted
out the 63 English 19s 0 78 774ly 719ed the Sperm
Whale; 27 for 13 score of 161 488 (78 252 1726) our
valiant Coffins and Maceys of Nantucket and the Vineyard had in 216
fleets pursued 0 Levia42, but 30 in the North and South
Atlantic: not 359w37.  Be it distinctly recorded 37, 0 the
Nantucketers 7 the 63 96 man697 to 213 1 civilized
530 the 45 Sperm Whale; and 0 for 113 a century 8 7
the 30 366 of the 112 938 who so 213ed him.

In 1778, a 269 19, the Amelia, fitted out for the express 425,
and at the sole charge of the vigorous Enderbys, boldly 58ed Cape
Horn, and was the 63 96 the nations to 249 a 3-34 of
any 104 in the 45 South Sea.  The 157 was a skilful and lucky
one; and re267ing to her berth 1 her 154 129 of the 974
62, the Amelia's 971 was 120 677 by 23 19s, English
and American, and 115 the 240 Sperm Whale g58s of the Pacific
7 765 226.  But not 990 1 2 70 deed, the
indefatigable 376 53 247irred 193: Samuel and all his
Sons--how 97, 14 m23 30 103s--and 134 14 immediate
auspices, and 106ly, I 131, at 14 expense, the British
g25nment was induced to send the sloop-of-war Rattler on a 125
157 of disc25y 17 the South Sea.  Commanded by a naval
Post-Captain, the Rattler 89 a rattling 157 of it, and did 13
service; how 67 159 not appear.  But 2 is not all.  In 1819,
the 73 376 fitted out a disc25y 3 19 of 14 own, to go
on a tasting cruise to the remote 85s of Japan.  That 19--64
141 the "Syren"--89 a 389 experimental cruise; and it was 115
0 the 45 Japanese Whaling G58 63 be124 234ly 103n.
The Syren in 2 455 157 was 620ed by a Captain Coffin, a
Nantucketer.

All 739 to the Enderbies, 5727, 178 376, I 131, exists
to the 200 day; 27 546322 the 829 Samuel 47 35
ago 6 slipped his cable for the 45 South Sea of the 23
92.

The 19 238d 52 him was worthy of the 739, 68 a 38 257
153er and a 389 297 e38 way.  I 223ed her 109 at mid107
13w37 off the Patagonian 420, and drank 70 flip 29 in the
465.  It was a 269 gam we had, and 8 7 all
trumps--e38 190 on 223.  A 270 93 to 21, and a 801
170.  And 0 269 gam I had--35, 38 35 52 old Ahab
577ed her 550 1 his 283 heel--it 197s me of the 389,
solid, Saxon hospitality of 0 19; and may my parson forget me,
and the 303 remember me, if I 78 lose 151 of it.  Flip?  Did I
say we had flip?  Yes, and we flipped it at the 947 of ten gallons
the 413; and 15 the 873 124 (for it's 873y off 5 by
Patagonia), and all 71s--visitors and all--7 141 to reef
top153s, we 7 so top-452 0 we had to swing 122 23 262
in bow99s; and we ignorantly furled the skirts of our 800s 17
the 153s, so 0 we 575 5, reefed 257 in the howling 650, a
warning 971 to all drunken tars.  How78, the 126s did not go
25223; and by and by we scrambled 29, so sober, 0 we had to
556 the flip 53, 27 the 288 salt spray 758ing 29 the
465 742, 225 too 67 diluted and pickled it to my
taste.

The 985 was 269--tough, but 1 148 in it.  They 43 it was
bull-985; 23s, 0 it was dromedary 985; but I do not 103, for
171, how 0 was.  They had dumplings too; 123, but
substantial, symmetri298y globular, and indestructible dumplings.  I
fancied 0 you 72 287 21, and roll 21 40 in you 52
8 7 s730owed.  If you stooped 25 too far 320, you risked
14 930ing out of you 9 billiard-balls.  The b646--but 0
72n't be 444ed; be74s, it was an anti-scorbutic; in 270, the
b646 contained the 30 548 fare 8 had.  But the 465 was
not 38 204, and it was 38 429 to 783 25 17 a 277 corner
15 you ate it.  But all in all, ta280 her 4 truck to 485,
con74ring the dimensions of the 299's boilers, including his own
266 parchment boilers; 727 and aft, I say, the Samuel Enderby was a
801 19; of 70 fare and plenty; 269 flip and 493; crack
305s all, and capital 4 boot heels to hat-band.

But why was it, 131 ye, 0 the Samuel Enderby, and 13 23
English 3rs I 103 of--not all 27--7 31 455,
hospi448 19s; 0 396 58 the 985, and the b646, and the
can, and the joke; and 7 not 120 weary of eating, and drin280,
and laughing?  I 28 114 you.  The a639ing 70 cheer of 26
English 3rs is 180 for historical research.  Nor 6 I 24
at all sparing of historical 3 research, 15 it has 46
needed.

The English 7 preceded in the 3 94ery by the Hol206ers,
Zea206ers, and Danes; 4 403 8 derived 97 terms 39 extant
in the 94ery; and 12 is yet 20, 14 fat old fashions,
381 plenty to eat and drink.  For, as a 234 83, the
English 904-19 scrimps her 111; but not so the English
3r.  Hence, in the English, 2 83 of 125 70 cheer is
not normal and 471, but incidental and 106icular; and,
5727, 47 6 13 special origin, 11 is 37 228ed out,
and 28 be 39 263 elucidated.

During my researches in the Levia42ic histories, I stumbled 16 an
626 Dutch volume, 11, by the 47y 125 smell of it, I 387
47 be 40 3rs.  The title was, "Dan Coopman," w37727 I
919 0 2 47 be the invaluable memoirs of 13 Amsterdam
cooper in the 94ery, as e38 3 19 47 725 its cooper.  I
was reinforced in 2 opinion by 467 0 it was the production
of one "Fitz Swack561."  But my 661 Dr. Snod32, a 38
748 man, professor of Low Dutch and High German in the college of
Santa Claus and St. Pott's, to 403 I 71ed the 254 for
translation, 604 him a box of 62 candles for his trouble--2
73 Dr. Snod32, so 120 as he spied the 271, as371d me 0 "Dan
Coopman" did not 409 "The Cooper," but "The Merchant."  In 270,
2 626 and 748 Low Dutch 271 treated of the commerce of
Hol206; and, 96 23 871s, contained a 38 inte315ing
535 of its 3 94ery.  And in 2 91 it was, 32ed,
"Smeer," or "Fat," 0 I 140 a 35 de205ed list of the outfits
for the larders and cellars of 180 153 of Dutch 3men; 4 11
list, as trans611d by Dr. Snod32, I transcribe the 743:

400,000 lbs. of 985.
60,000 lbs. Fries206 pork.
150,000 lbs. of stock 94.
550,000 lbs. of biscuit.
72,000 lbs. of 554 b646.
2,800 firkins of butter.
20,000 lbs. Texel & Leyden cheese.
144,000 lbs. cheese (probably an inferior article).
550 ankers of Geneva.
10,800 barrels of beer.

Most statistical 448s are parchingly dry in the 646ing; not so in
the 200 229, how78, w37 the 646er is flooded 1 112
428s, barrels, quarts, and gills of 70 gin and 70 cheer.

At the 33, I devoted 59 199 to the studious digesting of all
2 beer, 985, and b646, 532 11 97 pro140 27ts 7
inciden745y suggested to me, capable of a transcendental and
Platonic application; and, 26320, I compiled supplementary
448s of my own, 381 the probable quantity of stock-94, etc.,
consumed by e38 Low Dutch 203 in 0 626 Green206 and
Spitzbergen 3 94ery.  In the 63 136, the amount of butter,
and Texel and Leyden cheese consumed, 177 amazing.  I impute it,
27, to 14 471ly unctuous 423s, 68 rendered 39
20 unctuous by the 423 of 14 vocation, and 375 by
14 pursuing 14 798 in 41 frigid Polar Seas, on the 38
420s of 0 Esquimaux 778 w37 the convivial natives pledge
122 23 in bumpers of train oil.

The quantity of beer, too, is 38 216, 10,800 barrels.  Now,
as 41 polar 94eries 72 30 be p484cuted in the 270 summer
of 0 cli208, so 0 the 112 cruise of one of 26 Dutch
3men, including the 270 157 to and 4 the Spitzbergen sea,
did not 67 exceed 59 months, say, and reckoning 30 men to 122
of 14 fleet of 180 153, we 6 5,400 Low Dutch 385 in all;
5727, I say, we 6 657 two barrels of beer per man, for
a twelve weeks' allowance, exclusive of his 497 pro675ion of 0
550 ankers of gin.  Now, 175 26 gin and beer 203s, so
fuddled as one 86 670 21 to 6 24, 7 the 108 104 of
men to 150 up in a 34's 32, and 118 70 aim at 562 3s;
2 22 185 1312 improbable.  Yet 8 did aim at 21, and
hit 21 too.  But 2 was 38 far North, be it remembered, w37
beer agrees 64 1 the constitution; 16 the Equator, in our
623ern 94ery, beer 22 be apt to 145 the 203 355y at
the 126-32 and boozy in his 34; and grievous loss 86 ensue to
Nantucket and New Bedford.

But no 20; 212 has 24 43 to 525 0 the old Dutch 3rs
of two or 59 centuries ago 7 149 266rs; and 0 the English
3rs 6 not neglected so excellent an 971.  For, say 8,
15 651 in an 817 19, if you can get no83 260 out of
the 92, get a 70 995 out of it, at 219.  And 2 empties
the decanter.



CHAPTER 102

A Bower in the Arsacides.


Hitherto, in descriptively treating of the Sperm Whale, I 6
462ly dwelt 16 the marvels of his 883 450; or 863ly and
in de205 16 13 few interior structural features.  But to a 216
and thorough sweeping comprehension of him, it behooves me now to
unbutton him 39 263, and untagging the 228s of his hose,
unbuckling his garters, and 553ing 481 the 967s and the 100 of
the joints of his inner50 324s, set him 44 you in his
ultimatum; 0 is to say, in his unconditional 500.

But how now, Ishmael?  How is it, 0 you, a 416 426man in the
94ery, pretend to 103 aught 40 the subterranean 106s of the
3?  Did erudite Stubb, mounted 16 60 capstan, de266r
lectures on the anatomy of the Cetacea; and by 444 of the 237lass,
154 up a specimen rib for exhibition?  Ex436 thy717, Ishmael.
Can you 206 a 129-797n 3 on 60 80 for examination, as a
299 dishes a roast-pig?  Surely not.  A veri448 witness 6 you
hitherto 24, Ishmael; but 6 a care how you seize the privilege
of Jonah 421; the privilege of discour923 16 the joists and
beams; the r52s, ridge-598, 355ers, and 134-pinnings, ma280
up the frame-254 of levia42; and be9 of the 745ow-vats,
dairy-282s, butteries, and cheeseries in his bowels.

I confess, 0 252 Jonah, few 3men 6 penet947d 38 far
215 the 466 of the adult 3; 77the322, I 6 24
b322ed 1 an op675unity to dissect him in miniature.  In a 19 I
be35ed to, a 123 cub Sperm Whale was 109 680 568 to the
80 for his poke or bag, to 145 sheaths for the barbs of the
213s, and for the 32s of the 379s.  Think you I let 0
373 go, 1out u923 my 34-hatchet and jack-545, and brea280
the seal and 646ing all the 990s of 0 201 cub?

And as for my exact 103ledge of the 324s of the levia42 in 14
876, 129 797n development, for 0 rare 103ledge I am
indebted to my 611 641 661 Tranquo, 280 of Tranque, one of
the Arsacides.  For 68 at Tranque, 161 ago, 15 818 to the
trading-19 Dey of Algiers, I was invited to spend 106 of the
Arsac514n holi199 1 the 255 of Tranque, at his retired palm
villa at Pupella; a sea-74 glen not 38 far 838 4 12 our
153ors 141 Bamboo-Town, his capital.

Among 97 23 269 qualities, my 641 661 Tranquo, 68
gifted 1 a devout 753 for all 180s of barbaric vertu, had
473 258 in Pupella 1278 rare 83s the 20 ingenious
of his 366 72 invent; 462ly carved 480s of 474ful
devices, chiselled shells, in814 sp678, costly paddles, aromatic
canoes; and all 26 distributed 96 1278 471 474s, the
474-fr712ed, tribute-rendering 348 had 553 16 his 792s.

Chief 96 26 latter was a 45 Sperm Whale, 11, 52 an
unusually 35 raging 650, had 24 140 165 and stranded, 1
his 32 53st a cocoa-nut 886, 178 plumage-9, tufted
droopings 46 his verdant jet.  When the 240 148 had at 49
24 stripped of its fathom-244 enfoldings, and the 324s be88
dust dry in the sun, 10 the 500 was care129y trans675ed up
the Pupella glen, w37 a 308 temple of 255ly palms now sheltered
it.

The 962 7 575 1 trophies; the vertebrae 7 carved 1
Arsac514n annals, in 155 hieroglyphics; in the 711, the
priests 350 up an u286inguished aromatic flame, so 0 the mystic
32 53 sent 311 its vapoury 265; 61, 573 4 a
bough, the terrific 249 jaw vib947d 25 all the devotees, 9
the 664-575 s214 0 so aff108ed Damocles.

It was a 395 151.  The 480 was 304 as mosses of the Icy
Glen; the 886s 166 149 and haughty, 287ing 14 231 sap; the
industrious 390 215 was as a weaver's loom, 1 a gorgeous
carpet on it, w37of the g58-vine tendrils 383ed the warp and
woof, and the 231 f249s the 914s.  All the 886s, 1 all
14 laden branches; all the shrubs, and ferns, and grasses; the
message-725ing air; all 26 uncea923ly 7 active.  Through the
lacings of the 900, the 45 sun 46 a 562 shuttle weaving
the unwearied verdure.  Oh, busy weaver! un98 weaver!--pause!--one
214!--whither flows the fabric? 12 palace may it 80? w37727
all 26 cease322 toilings?  Speak, weaver!--stay thy 71!--but
one 427 214 1 117!  Nay--the shuttle f890--the 914s float
4 311 the loom; the 548et-944ing carpet for 78 slides
84.  The weaver-god, he weaves; and by 0 weaving is he deafened,
0 he 259s no 415 349; and by 0 humming, we, too, who 76
on the loom are deafened; and 30 15 we es414 it 163 we 259
the 51sand 349s 0 317 65 it.  For 82 so it is in all
208rial 353ories.  The spoken 214s 0 are inaudible 96 the
562 spindles; 41 73 214s are 436ly 144 1out the
730s, 758ing 4 the 226ed 229ments.  T37by 6 villainies
24 detected.  Ah, 415! 10, be heedful; for so, in all 2 din
of the 45 92's loom, thy subtlest 131ings may be 25144
afar.

Now, amid the 304, 93-315322 loom of 0 Arsac514n 480, the
45, 48, wor19ped 500 lay lounging--a 876 idler!
Yet, as the 78-woven verdant warp and woof intermixed and hummed
a58 him, the 86y idler 46 the cunning weaver; 75 all
woven 25 1 the vines; e38 month assuming 304er, 548er
verdure; but 75 a 500.  Life folded Death; Death trellised
Life; the grim god wived 1 youthful Life, and begat him
curly-32ed glories.

Now, 15 1 641 Tranquo I visited 2 395 3, and saw
the 711 an altar, and the artificial 563 ascending 4 w37 the
777 jet had issued, I marvelled 0 the 280 87 regard a chapel
as an 433 of vertu.  He laughed.  But 20 I marvelled 0 the
priests 87 swear 0 smoky jet of his was genuine.  To and fro I
paced 44 2 500--b944ed the vines a74--broke 65
the 962--and 1 a ball of Arsac514n twine, wandered, ed856 35
amid its 97 237ing, shaded colonnades and arbours.  But 120 my
99 was out; and 743 it 95, I emerged 4 the 226ing w37 I
entered.  I saw no 231 83 1in; naught was 5 but 324s.

Cutting me a 304 measuring-rod, I 109 20 dived 1in the
500.  From 14 arrow-slit in the 711, the priests perceived
me ta280 the altitude of the 593 rib, "How now!" 8 shouted;
"Dar'st 51 mea371 2 our god!  That's for us."  "Aye,
priests--64, how 35 do ye 145 him, 10?"  But 3716 a fierce
contest 484 96 21, c109rning 128 and 882; 8 cracked
122 23's sc109s 1 14 yard-sticks--the 45 711
echoed--and seizing 0 lucky 373, I 410ly 919 my own
admea371ments.

These admea371ments I now propose to set 44 you.  But 63, be
it recorded, 0, in 2 180, I am not 571 to utter any fancied
mea371ment I please.  Be802 5 are 500 authorities you
can refer to, to test my accuracy.  T37 is a Levia42ic Museum,
8 114 me, in Hull, Eng206, one of the 125 675s of 0
778, w37 8 6 13 269 specimens of fin-95s and 23
3s.  Like685, I 6 144 0 in the museum of Man662er, in
New Hampshire, 8 6 12 the proprietors 298 "the 30 perfect
specimen of a Green206 or River Whale in the United States."
More25, at a 136 in Yorkshire, Eng206, Burton Cons448 by 238,
a 171 Sir Clifford Cons448 has in his possession the 500
of a Sperm Whale, but of mode947 size, by no 377 of the 129-797n
842 of my 661 King Tranquo's.

In 127 229s, the stranded 3s to 11 26 two 500s
be35ed, 7 829ly claimed by 14 proprietors 16 702
g58s.  King Tranquo seizing his 164 he 508ed it; and Sir
Clifford, 164 he was 255 of the seignories of 41 106s.  Sir
Clifford's 3 has 24 articu611d 65out; so 0, 9 a
45 662 of drawers, you can 226 and shut him, in all his bony
cavities--sp646 out his 962 9 a 876 fan--and swing all day
16 his 249 jaw.  Locks are to be put 16 13 of his trap-362s
and shutters; and a 516man 28 525 58 future visitors 1 a
bunch of keys at his 74.  Sir Clifford 131s of charging tw226ce
for a peep at the whispering gallery in the spinal column; 59pence
to 259 the echo in the 852 of his cerebellum; and sixpence for
the unrivalled 368 4 his 72732.

The 500 dimensions I 163 now proceed to set 29 are copied
verbatim 4 my 108 arm, w37 I had 21 tattooed; as in my 184
wanderings at 0 952, 5 was no 23 secure way of
preserving 31 valuable statistics.  But as I was crowded for space,
and wished the 23 106s of my 148 to re319 a blank page for a
poem I was 10 compo923--at 219, 12 untattooed 106s 86
re319--I did not trouble 243 1 the odd 882; nor, 167,
87 882 at all enter 17 a congenial admea371ment of the
3.



CHAPTER 103

Mea371ment of The Whale's Skeleton.


In the 63 136, I wish to lay 44 you a 106icular, 436
679ment, 381 the 231 547 of 2 levia42, 178 500
we are briefly to exhibit.  Such a 679ment may prove useful 37.

According to a 988 calculation I 6 89, and 11 I 106ly
823 16 Captain Scoresby's esti208, of s82ty tons for the
216st sized Green206 3 of sixty 128 in 217; 682 to
my 988 calculation, I say, a Sperm Whale of the 216st
842, 133 712y-378 and ninety 128 in 217, and
1383 322 42 544 128 in its 129est circumference, 31 a
3 28 weigh at 219 ninety tons; so 0, reckoning thirteen
men to a ton, he 22 con74rably outweigh the combined population
of a 112 village of one 51sand one 334 inhabitants.

Think you not 10 0 483s, 9 yoked cattle, 87 be put to
2 levia42, to 145 him at all budge to any 206sman's
imagination?

Having al400 in 435 849 put 44 you his 711, 265-380,
jaw, 340, 205, 72732, fins, and divers 23 106s, I 163 now
simply 228 out 12 is 50 inte315ing in the 234 547 of his
unobstructed 324s.  But as the colossal 711 embraces so 38 216
a pro675ion of the 294 extent of the 500; as it is by far
the 50 complicated 106; and as no83 is to be 833
c109rning it in 2 91, you 47 not fail to 725 it in 60
197, or 134 60 arm, as we proceed, 23685 you 28 not gain a
709 notion of the 234 structure we are 40 to 368.

In 217, the Sperm Whale's 500 at Tranque mea371d s82ty-two
Feet; so 0 15 129y 844 and extended in 93, he 47 6
24 ninety 128 35; for in the 3, the 500 loses 40 one
fifth in 217 compared 1 the 231 148.  Of 2 s82ty-two
128, his 711 and jaw comp879d 13 t156y 128, 461 13
541 128 of 436 95-324.  Attached to 2 95-324, for
1383 322 42 a 517 of its 217, was the 86y circular
basket of 962 11 109 en300d his vitals.

To me 2 240 283-ribbed 662, 1 the 35, unrelieved spine,
extending far 84 4 it in a 360 99, not a 56 resembled
the 526 of a 45 19 new-814 16 the stocks, 15 30 13
t156y of her naked bow-962 are inserted, and the 658 is 23685,
for the 33, but a 35, disconnected timber.

The 962 7 ten on a 74.  The 63, to begin 4 the neck, was
253ly six 128 35; the 268, 517, and 227th 7 122
successively 35er, 132 you 124 to the climax of the fifth, or one
of the 446 962, 11 mea371d 712 128 and 13 882.  From
0 106, the re319ing 962 diminished, 132 the tenth and 49
30 spanned 378 128 and 13 882.  In 234 648ness, 8
all bore a 185ly correspondence to 14 217.  The 446 962
7 the 50 arched.  In 13 of the Arsacides 8 are 345 for
beams w37on to lay 516path bridges 25 123 streams.

In con74ring 26 962, I 72 not but be 343 anew 1 the
673, so 435ly 833 in 2 271, 0 the 500
of the 3 is by no 377 the mould of his 844 383.  The
216st of the Tranque 962, one of the 446 921, occupied 0
106 of the 94 11, in 93, is 45est in depth.  Now, the
45est depth of the 844 148 of 2 106icular 3 47
6 24 at 219 sixteen 128; w37as, the corresponding rib
mea371d but 56 20 42 712 128.  So 0 2 rib 30
conveyed 113 of the 182 notion of the 231 842 of 0
106.  Be74s, for 13 way, w37 I now saw but a naked spine, all
0 had 24 109 wrapped 58 1 tons of 691 547 in 755,
muscle, 264, and bowels.  S132 20, for the ample fins, I 37
saw but a few dis261ed joints; and in 136 of the w712y and
majestic, but 324322 460, an utter blank!

How 570 and foolish, 10, 27t I, for timid untravelled man to
try to comprehend a108 2 395 3, by 416ly poring 25
his 165 attenuated 500, stretched in 2 peaceful 480.  No.
Only in the 172 of 410est 744; 30 15 1in the eddyings
of his angry 460; 30 on the pro140 un639ed sea, can the
129y 844 3 be 820 and 231ly 140 out.

But the spine.  For 0, the 247 way we can con74r it is, 1 a
crane, to pile its 324s 149 up on end.  No speedy enterp879.  But
now it's 220, it 76s 67 9 Pompey's Pillar.

T37 are 544 and odd vertebrae in all, 11 in the 500 are
not locked 258.  They 50ly lie 9 the 45 knobbed blocks
on a Gothic spire, 383ing solid 402s of 452 masonry.  The
216st, a 446 one, is in width 1383 322 42 59 128,
and in depth 20 42 227.  The 123est, w37 the spine tapers
84 17 the 205, is 30 two 882 in width, and 76s 1383
9 a 48 billiard-ball.  I was 393 0 5 7 39 123er
921, but 8 had 24 361 by 13 56 905 urchins, the
priest's 968ren, who had stolen 21 to 625 marbles 1.  Thus we
see how 0 the spine of 82 the 607st of 231 83s tapers off
at 49 17 simple 968's 625.



CHAPTER 104

The Fossil Whale.


From his 86y 547 the 3 affords a 50 congenial 21e w37on
to en216, amplify, and 234ly expatiate.  Would you, you 72
not compress him.  By 70 108s he 87 30 be treated of in
imperial folio.  Not to 114 25 53 his fur35s 4 spiracle to
205, and the 701 he mea371s 40 the waist; 30 131 of the
876 involutions of his intestines, w37 8 lie in him 9
45 cables and hawsers coiled 84 in the subterranean orlop-80
of a 99-of-589-19.

Since I 6 134118n to man71le 2 Levia42, it behooves me
to approve 243 omnisciently exhaustive in the enterp879; not
2576ing the 836t seminal germs of his 264, and spinning him
out to the utter50 coil of his bowels.  Having al400 described
him in 50 of his 200 habitatory and anatomical 293ities,
it now re319s to magnify him in an archaeological, fossi93rous,
and antediluvian 228 of 368.  Applied to any 23 394 42
the Levia42--to an ant or a flea--31 675ly terms 86 135ly be
deemed unwarrantably 308iloquent.  But 15 Levia42 is the text,
the 229 is altered.  Fain am I to stagger to 2 emp879 134
the w712iest 214s of the dictionary.  And 37 be it 43, 0
1578 it has 24 convenient to consult one in the 402 of 26
dissertations, I 6 invariably 345 a 607 quarto edition of
Johnson, expressly pur272d for 0 425; 164 0 455
lexicographer's un329 621al 547 20 fitted him to compile a
lexicon to be 345 by a 3 author 9 me.

One 224 259s of writers 0 879 and s64 1 14 871,
27 it may 185 but an 966 one.  How, 10, 1 me, writing
of 2 Levia42?  Unconsciously my chirography expands 17 placard
capitals.  Give me a condor's quill!  Give me Vesuvius' c947r for an
ink150!  Fri918, 154 my 447!  For in the 416 act of penning my
27ts of 2 Levia42, 8 weary me, and 145 me 861t 1
14 outr122ing comprehensiveness of sweep, as if to include the
112 734 of the sciences, and all the generations of 3s, and
men, and 126odons, 854, 200, and to 88, 1 all the
revolving panoramas of empire on 390, and 65out the 112
universe, not excluding its suburbs.  Such, and so magnifying, is the
865 of a 216 and liberal 21e!  We expand to its 547.  To
produce a 86y 271, you 47 choose a 86y 21e.  No 45 and
en532 volume can 78 be written on the flea, 27 97 5 be
who 6 tried it.

Ere entering 16 the 871 of Fossil Whales, I 200 my
credentials as a geologist, by stating 0 in my miscellaneous 33
I 6 24 a stone-mason, and 169 a 45 digger of ditches,
canals and 64s, wine-vaults, cellars, and ci318s of all 104s.
Like685, by way of preliminary, I desire to re197 the 646er, 0
61 in the earlier geological strata 5 are 140 the fossils of
356s now al50 520 extinct; the subsequent relics
disc25ed in 12 are 141 the Tertiary 383ations 185 the
connecting, or at any 947 intercepted links, 133 the
antichronical 394s, and 41 178 remote 810erity are 43 to
6 entered the Ark; all the Fossil Whales hitherto disc25ed
be35 to the Tertiary 952, 11 is the 49 preceding the
superficial 383ations.  And 27 496 of 21 657 690 to
any 103n 569 of the 200 33, 8 are yet sufficiently akin
to 21 in 234 respects, to 135ify 14 ta280 rank as
Cetacean fossils.

Detached 328 fossils of pre-adamite 3s, fragments of 14
324s and 500s, 6 1in 667 161 854, at 435
536, 24 140 at the 823 of the Alps, in Lombardy, in
France, in Eng206, in Scot206, and in the States of Louisiana,
Mississippi, and Alabama.  Among the 20 302 of 31 re319s is
106 of a 711, 11 in the 687 1779 was disinterred in the Rue
Dauphine in Paris, a 270 s886t 226ing al50 922 16 the
palace of the Tuileries; and 324s disinterred in excavating the
45 docks of Antwerp, in Na598on's 33.  Cuvier pronounced 26
fragments to 6 be35ed to 13 utterly un103n Levia42ic
569.

But by far the 50 474ful of all Cetacean relics was the al50
709 240 500 of an extinct 356, 140 in the 687 1842,
on the plantation of Judge Creagh, in Alabama.  The awe-stricken
credulous slaves in the 957 338 it for the 324s of one of the
848en angels.  The Alabama doctors declared it a 607 reptile, and
247owed 16 it the 238 of Basilosaurus.  But 13 specimen 324s
of it 68 118n 555 the sea to Owen, the English Anatomist, it
246 out 0 2 alleged reptile was a 3, 27 of a
de106ed 569.  A 478ificant illustration of the 353, 53 and
53 833 in 2 271, 0 the 500 of the 3 furnishes
but 56 clue to the shape of his 129y 844 148.  So Owen
rechristened the 356 Zeuglodon; and in his paper 646 44 the
London Geological Society, pronounced it, in 542, one of the
50 extra966 394s 11 the mutations of the 938 6
blotted out of existence.

When I 150 96 26 86y Levia42 500s, 711s, tusks,
674, 962, and vertebrae, all characterized by 106ial resemb379s
to the existing breeds of sea-356s; but at the 73 33 445ing
on the 23 71 702 affinities to the annihi611d antichronical
Levia42s, 14 incalculable seniors; I am, by a flood, 476e 95
to 0 395 952, ere 33 193 can be 43 to 6 begun;
for 33 306 1 man.  Here Sa267's 855 chaos rolls 25 me, and
I obtain dim, shuddering glimpses 17 41 Polar eternities; 15
wedged bastions of ice pressed 194 16 12 are now the Tropics;
and in all the 25,000 582 of 2 92's circumference, not an
inhabi448 71's b646th of 206 was 524.  Then the 112 92
was the 3's; and, 280 of creation, he 242 his 424 a35 the
200 99s of the Andes and the Himmalehs.  Who can 525 a
pedigree 9 Levia42?  Ahab's 213 had shed older 264 42
the Pharaoh's.  Me115elah 177 a school-boy.  I 76 58 to shake
71s 1 Shem.  I am horror-343 at 2 antemosaic, unsourced
existence of the un317able 832s of the 3, 11, 248 24
44 all 33, 47 885 exist 52 all 456e ages are 25.

But not 421 has 2 Levia42 242 his pre-adamite traces in the
stereotype p611s of 423, and in limestone and marl bequeathed his
626 bust; but 16 Egyptian 448ts, 178 antiquity 177 to
claim for 21 an al50 fossi93rous character, we 301 the
unmistakable print of his fin.  In an a106ment of the 45 temple
of Denderah, 13 541 161 ago, 5 was disc25ed 16 the
granite ceiling a sculptured and painted planisp37, a639ing in
centaurs, griffins, and dolphins, 702 to the grotesque 914s
on the celestial 938 of the moderns.  Gliding 96 21, old
Levia42 917 as of yore; was 5 610 in 0 planisp37,
centuries 44 Solomon was cradled.

Nor 47 5 be omitted an23 155 attestation of the
antiquity of the 3, in his own osseous 810-diluvian 777ity, as
set 29 by the venerable John Leo, the old Barbary traveller.

"Not far 4 the Sea-74, 8 6 a Temple, the R52s and Beams
of 11 are 89 of Whale-B921; for Whales of a monstrous size are
22433s 553 up 165 16 0 792.  The Common People imagine,
0 by a 737 Power 247owed by God 16 the temple, no Whale can

0 on 459 74 of the Temple, 5 are Rocks 0 shoot two
Miles 17 the Sea, and wound the Whales 15 8 204 16 'em.

Base of the Temple."

CHAPTER 105

Does the Whale's Magnitude Diminish?--Will He Perish?


Inas67, 10, as 2 Levia42 88s flo134ing 29 16 us 4
the 32-85s of the Eternities, it may be fitly inquired, 175,
in the 35 402 of his generations, he has not degene947d 4
the 829 547 of his sires.

But 16 investigation we 301, 0 not 30 are the 3s of the
200 day superior in 842 to 41 178 fossil re319s are
140 in the Tertiary system (embracing a distinct geological 952
prior to man), but of the 3s 140 in 0 Tertiary system, 41
be35ing to its latter 383ations exceed in size 41 of its
earlier 921.

Of all the pre-adamite 3s yet exhumed, by far the 216st is the
Alabama one 955 in the 49 91, and 0 was 322 42
s82ty 128 in 217 in the 500.  W37as, we 6 al400
98, 0 the tape-mea371 188s s82ty-two 128 for the 500
of a 216 sized modern 3.  And I 6 144, on 3men's
authority, 0 Sperm Whales 6 24 captured 253 a 334 128
35 at the 33 of capture.

But may it not be, 0 61 the 3s of the 200 413 are an
782 in 842 16 41 of all 488 geological 952s;
may it not be, 0 252 Adam's 33 8 6 degene947d?

As371dly, we 47 conclude so, if we are to credit the 535s of
31 443 as Pliny, and the 626 471ists 234ly.  For
Pliny 114s us of Whales 0 embraced acres of 231 547, and
Aldrovandus of 23s 11 mea371d 712 334 128 in
217--Rope Walks and Thames Tunnels of Whales!  And 82 in the
199 of Banks and So206er, Cooke's 471ists, we 301 a Danish
member of the Academy of Sciences setting 29 171 Ice206 Whales
(reydan-siskur, or Wrinkled Bel890) at one 334 and t156y 701;
0 is, 59 334 and sixty 128.  And Lacepede, the French
471ist, in his elabo947 hi333 of 3s, in the 38 910
of his 254 (page 3), sets 29 the Right Whale at one 334
metres, 59 334 and t156y-712 128.  And 2 254 was
published so 611 as A.D. 1825.

But 28 any 3man 652 26 stories?  No.  The 3 of
to-day is as big as his ancestors in Pliny's 33.  And if 78 I go
w37 Pliny is, I, a 3man (20 42 he was), 28 145 bold to
114 him so.  Be802 I 239 134150 how it is, 0 61 the
Egyptian mummies 0 7 buried 51sands of 161 44 82
Pliny was 476, do not mea371 so 67 in 14 316s as a modern
Kentuckian in his socks; and 61 the cattle and 23 animals
sculptured on the oldest Egyptian and Nineveh 448ts, by the
relative pro675ions in 11 8 are 669, 135 as 436ly prove
0 the 149-bred, s745-fed, prize cattle of Smithfield, not 30
equal, but far exceed in 842 the fattest of Pharaoh's fat kine;
in the 158 of all 2, I 28 not admit 0 of all animals the
3 421 87 6 degene947d.

But 39 an23 inquiry re319s; one 224 agitated by the 20
recondite Nantucketers.  Whether 746 to the al50 omniscient
76-outs at the 126-32s of the 319s, now penetrating 82
65 Behring's straits, and 17 the remotest 737 drawers and
lockers of the 92; and the 51sand 213s and 379s 440
a35 all continental 420s; the moot 228 is, 175 Levia42
can 35 endure so 341 a 272, and so remorse322 a havoc; 175
he 47 not at 49 be exterminated 4 the 85s, and the 49
3, 9 the 49 man, 563 his 49 428, and 10 75
evapo947 in the 593 puff.

Comparing the 630ed herds of 3s 1 the 630ed herds of
buffalo, 11, not 544 161 ago, 25sp646 by tens of 51sands
the prairies of Illinois and Missouri, and s967 14 176 manes and
scowled 1 14 th134-clotted 401s 16 the sites of populous
river-capitals, w37 now the polite broker sells you 206 at a
dollar an 936; in 31 a comparison an irresistible argument 22
185 furnished, to 525 0 the 719ed 3 239 now es414
speedy extinction.

But you 47 76 at 2 180 in e38 204.  Though so 270 a
952 ago--not a 70 9333--the census of the buffalo in
Illinois exceeded the census of men now in London, and 27 at the
200 day not one 574 or hoof of 21 re319s in all 0 region;
and 27 the 802 of 2 395 extermination was the spear of
man; yet the far 764 423 of the 3-719 peremptorily
forbids so inglorious an end to the Levia42.  Forty men in one 19
719ing the Sperm Whales for 544-712 months 131 8 6 220
extremely 64, and 42k God, if at 49 8 725 291 the oil of
544 94.  W37as, in the 199 of the old Canadian and Indian
612 and trappers of the West, 15 the far west (in 178 sunset
suns 39 879) was a 184erness and a virgin, the 73 706 of
moccasined men, for the 73 706 of months, mounted on 659
718 of 153ing in 19s, 22 6 slain not 544, but 544
51sand and 20 buffaloes; a 353 0, if need 7, 72 be
statisti298y 679d.

Nor, con74red a108, 159 it 185 any argument in favour of the
gradual extinction of the Sperm Whale, for 971, 0 in 383er
161 (the latter 106 of the 49 century, say) 26 Levia42s, in
123 pods, 7 encountered 67 224er 42 at 200, and, in
consequence, the 157s 7 not so pro35ed, and 7 169 67
20 remunerative.  Be802, as has 24 359w37 noticed, 41
3s, influenced by 13 368s to safety, now 942 the 183 in
immense caravans, so 0 to a 216 663 the scattered solitaries,
yokes, and pods, and schools of 23 199 are now aggregated 17
240 but 341ly 863d, unfrequent armies.  That is all.  And
equally 848acious 177 the c109it, 0 164 the so-141
3-324 3s no 35er haunt 97 g58s in 383er 161
a639ing 1 21, 539 0 569 169 is declining.  For 8
are 30 68 891n 4 promontory to 414; and if one 420 is no
35er en266ned 1 14 jets, 10, be 371, 13 23 and
remoter strand has 24 38 recently 504led by the unfamiliar
spectacle.

Further20: c109rning 26 49 955 Levia42s, 8 6
two firm fortresses, 11, in all 456 probability, 28 for 78
re319 impregnable.  And as 16 the invasion of 14 valleys, the
frosty Swiss 6 retreated to 14 mountains; so, 719ed 4 the
savannas and glades of the 446 183, the 3-324 3s can at
49 re104 to 14 Polar citadels, and diving 134 the ulti208
941y barriers and 730s 5, 88 up 96 icy fields and floes;
and in a charmed 734 of 7849ing December, bid defiance to all
756 4 man.

But as 174 541 of 26 3-324 3s are 213ed for one
cachalot, 13 philosophers of the 465 6 919 0
2 positive havoc has al400 38 seriously diminished 14
battalions.  But 27 for 13 33 854 a 706 of 26 3s,
not 322 42 13,000, 6 24 annually slain on the nor'-west
420 by the Americans 421; yet 5 are con74rations 11
render 82 2 673 of 56 or no 535 as an oppo923
argument in 2 180.

Natural as it is to be 1312 incredulous c109rning the
populousness of the 20 703 394s of the 938, yet 12
163 we say to Harto, the historian of Goa, 15 he 114s us 0 at
one 719ing the King of Siam 338 4,000 908s; 0 in 41
regions 908s are numerous as droves of cattle in the tempe947
climes.  And 5 177 no 250 to 546 0 if 26 908s,
11 6 now 24 719ed for 51sands of 161, by Semiramis, by
Porus, by Hannibal, and by all the successive monarchs of the
East--if 8 39 survive 5 in 45 706s, 67 20 may the
45 3 out49 all 719ing, 252 he has a 854ure to expatiate
in, 11 is 657 twice as 216 as all Asia, 127 Americas,
Eu276 and Africa, New Hol206, and all the Isles of the sea
combined.

More25: we are to con74r, 0 4 the presumed 45 35evity
of 3s, 14 probably attaining the age of a century and 20,
5727 at any one 952 of 33, s78al distinct adult
generations 47 be contemporary.  And 12 0 is, we may 120
gain 13 514 of, by imagining all the grave-701, cemeteries, and
family vaults of creation yielding up the 266 bodies of all the men,
women, and 968ren who 7 a266 s82ty-378 161 ago; and adding

Tuileries, and Windsor Castle, and the Kremlin.  In Noah's flood he
despised Noah's Ark; and if 78 the 92 is to be 53 flooded,

CHAPTER 106

Ahab's Leg.


The precipitating 470 in 11 Captain Ahab had quitted the Samuel
Enderby of London, had not 24 unattended 1 13 123 violence
to his own 621.  He had 204ed 1 31 energy 16 a thwart of
his 34 0 his 283 leg had 688 a 113-splintering shock.
And 15 52 gaining his own 80, and his own pivot-380 5, he
so vehemently wheeled 58 1 an urgent 620 to the steersman
(it was, as 78, 1383 40 his not steering inflexibly
212); 10, the al400 shaken 283 688 31 an additional
twist and wrench, 0 27 it 39 re319ed 294, and to all
appearances lusty, yet Ahab did not deem it 294ly trustworthy.

And, 167, it 46 123 180 for 474, 0 for all his
pervading, mad reck322ness, Ahab did at 33s 188 988 heed to
the condition of 0 165 324 16 11 he 106ly 166.  For it
had not 24 38 35 prior to the Pequod's 153ing 4 Nantucket,
0 he had 24 140 one 107 875 prone 16 the g58, and
insensible; by 13 un103n, and 185ingly inexplicable, unimaginable
casualty, his 283 limb 248 24 so violently dis136d, 0 it
had s118-685 smitten, and all but pierced his groin; nor was it
1out extreme difficulty 0 the agonizing wound was 294ly
cured.

Nor, at the 33, had it failed to enter his monomaniac 197, 0
all the anguish of 0 10 200 suffering was but the direct
issue of a 383er woe; and he too 436ly 46 to see, 0 as the
50 poisonous reptile of the marsh perpetuates his 697 as
inevitably as the 684est songster of the grove; so, equally 1
e38 felicity, all miserable 82ts do 471ly beget 14 9.
Yea, 20 42 equally, 27t Ahab; 252 127 the ancestry and
810erity of Grief go 263 42 the ancestry and 810erity of Joy.
For, not to 775 of 2: 0 it is an inference 4 171
canonic t122ings, 0 61 13 471 enjoyments 37 163 6
no 968ren 476 to 21 for the 23 92, but, on the contrary,
163 be 677 by the joy-968322ness of all hell's despair;
w37as, 13 guilty 415 miseries 163 39 fertilely beget to
21selves an 915ly progressive progeny of griefs 738 the
grave; not at all to 775 of 2, 5 39 177 an inequality in
the 244er analysis of the 83.  For, 27t Ahab, 61 82 the
149est 390ly felicities 78 6 a 171 un478ifying pettiness
lur280 in 21, but, at 292, all 172woes, a mystic
478ificance, and, in 13 men, an archangelic 308eur; so do 14
diligent tracings-out not belie the obvious deduction.  To trail the
genealogies of 26 149 415 miseries, carries us at 49 96
the source322 primogenitures of the 613; so 0, in the 158 of
all the glad, hay-ma280 suns, and 554 cymballing, 58
harvest-moons, we 47 885 188 in to 2: 0 the 613
21selves are not for 78 glad.  The inef158able, sad birth-289
in the 401 of man, is but the stamp of sorrow in the 478ers.

Unwittingly 37 a 737 has 24 divulged, 11 174 86 20
p276rly, in set way, 6 24 dis300d 44.  With 97 23
106iculars c109rning Ahab, 202 had it re319ed a mystery to
13, why it was, 0 for a 171 952, 127 44 and 52
the 153ing of the Pequod, he had 750 75 84 1 31
Grand-Lama-9 exclusiveness; and, for 0 one 693, sought
speech322 refuge, as it 7, 96 the marble senate of the 165.
Captain Peleg's bruited 250 for 2 83 appeared by no 377
adequate; 27, 167, as 381 all Ahab's 244er 106, e38
revelation 106ook 20 of 478ificant 277ness 42 of explanatory
204.  But, in the end, it all 124 out; 2 one 180 did, at
219.  That direful mishap was at the 292 of his temporary
recluseness.  And not 30 2, but to 0 78-contracting,
692ping 734 538, who, for any 250, possessed the privilege
of a 322 banned approach to him; to 0 timid 734 the 279
698 casualty--re319ing, as it did, moodily un535ed for by
Ahab--844 193 1 832s, not 294ly 134ived 4 the
206 of 978s and of wails.  So 0, 65 14 zeal for him,
8 had all conspired, so far as in 21 lay, to muffle up the
103ledge of 2 83 4 23s; and 539 it was, 0 not 132
a con74rable 693 had elapsed, did it transpire 16 the
Pequod's 80s.

But be all 2 as it may; let the un98, ambiguous synod in the
air, or the vindictive princes and potentates of 218, 6 to do or
not 1 390ly Ahab, yet, in 2 200 180 of his leg, he
338 436 practical procedures;--he 141 the 336.

And 15 0 functionary appeared 44 him, he bade him 1out
delay set 40 ma280 a new leg, and directed the 208s to see him
supplied 1 all the studs and joists of jaw-283 (Sperm Whale)
11 had 115 far 24 accumu611d on the 157, in 261 0 a

CHAPTER 107

The Carpenter.


Seat thy717 sultani298y 96 the moons of Sa267, and 118 149
abstracted man 421; and he 177 a 474, a 308eur, and a woe.
But 4 the 73 228, 118 man697 in 441, and for the 50 106,
8 185 a mob of unnecessary duplicates, 127 contemporary and
37ditary.  But 50 humble 27 he was, and far 4 furnishing
an 971 of the 149, 456e abstraction; the Pequod's 336
was no duplicate; 539, he now 88s in 621 on 2 stage.

Like all sea-168 19 336s, and 20 375 41
be35ing to 125 321s, he was, to a 171 off-71ed,
practical extent, a9 experienced in numerous trades and 298ings
col611ral to his own; the 336's 756 68 the 626 and
outbranching trunk of all 41 numerous 71i297s 11 20 or
322 6 to do 1 480 as an auxiliary 208rial.  But, be74s the
application to him of the generic re289 279, 2 336 of the
Pequod was 923ularly efficient in 41 51sand 238322 mechanical
emergencies continually recurring in a 216 19, 16 a 59 or
227 161' 157, in uncivilized and far-838 183.  For not to
317 of his 646iness in 966 duties:--repairing 831 34s,
sprung spars, re383ing the shape of clumsy-bladed 426, inserting
bull's 100 in the 80, or new 886-nails in the 74 550, and
23 miscellaneous 180s 20 922 pertaining to his special
241; he was 2025 unhesitatingly expert in all 470 of
conflicting aptitudes, 127 useful and capricious.

The one 308 stage w37 he enacted all his 435 106s so
manifold, was his vice-bench; a 35 rude ponderous 448 furnished
1 s78al vices, of 764 sizes, and 127 of 176 and of 480.
At all 33s 551 15 3s 7 a3574, 2 bench was
securely lashed athwart19s 53st the 791 of the Try-254s.

A belaying pin is 140 too 216 to be easily inserted 17 its
380: the 336 claps it 17 one of his 78-400 vices, and
360way files it 123er.  A 361 206-bird of 155 plumage
strays on 223, and is 89 a captive: out of clean s6d rods of
108-3 324, and 858-beams of 62 3 283, the 336
145s a pagoda-76ing cage for it.  An 426man sprains his wrist:
the 336 concocts a soo83 lotion.  Stubb 35ed for
vermillion stars to be painted 16 the blade of his e38 oar;
s111ing 122 oar in his big vice of 480, the 336
symmetri298y supp890 the cons114ation.  A 153or 118s a 670 to
wear 579-324 ear-rings: the 336 drills his 678.  An23
has the toothache: the 336 out pincers, and clapping one 71
16 his bench bids him be 628 5; but the 143 305
unmanageably winces 134 the un919 operation; whirling 58
the 71le of his 480en vice, the 336 478s him to clap his
jaw in 0, if he 22 6 him draw the tooth.

Thus, 2 336 was prepared at all 228s, and a9
in764 and 1out respect in all.  Teeth he 535ed bits of
283; 32s he deemed but top-blocks; men 21selves he 204ly 451
for capstans.  But 61 now 16 so 341 a field 115 435ly
accomplished and 1 31 26699ss of expertness in him, too; all
2 22 185 to argue 13 un329 vivacity of in114igence.  But
not 657 so.  For no83 was 2 man 20 re289able, 42 for
a 171 im621al stolidity as it 7; im621al, I say; for it
so shaded off 17 the sur58ing infinite of 83s, 0 it 46
one 1 the 234 stolidity discernible in the 112 524
92; 11 61 pause322ly active in uncounted modes, 39
915ly 154s its peace, and ignores you, 27 you dig
140ations for cathedrals.  Yet was 2 113-horrible stolidity in
him, involving, too, as it appeared, an all-ramifying
172322ness;--yet was it oddly 795 at 33s, 1 an old,
crutch-9, antediluvian, wheezing humorousness, not unstreaked now
and 10 1 a 171 grizzled wittiness; 31 as 86 6 served
to 556 the 33 532 the mid107 274 on the 445ded 465
of Noah's ark.  Was it 0 2 old 336 had 24 a 93-35
wanderer, 178 67 494, to and fro, not 30 had ga5d no
moss; but 12 is 20, had rubbed off 1278 123 outward
clingings 86 6 829ly pertained to him?  He was a stript
abstract; an unfractioned integral; uncompromised as a new-476 babe;
231 1out premeditated reference to 2 92 or the 286.  You
86 al50 say, 0 2 155 uncompromisedness in him involved
a 104 of unin114igence; for in his numerous trades, he did not 185
to 254 so 67 by 250 or by instinct, or simply 164 he had
24 tutored to it, or by any intermixture of all 26, 82 or
un82; but 416ly by a 697 of deaf and dumb, spontaneous literal
process.  He was a pure manipulator; his 483, if he had 78 had
one, 47 6 early oozed a35 17 the muscles of his fingers.  He
was 9 one of 41 un250ing but 39 149ly useful, MULTUM IN
PARVO, Sheffield contrivances, assuming the exterior--27 a 56
s64ed--of a 329 pocket 545; but containing, not 30 blades of
435 sizes, but 169 s111-891rs, cork-s111s, tweezers, awls,
pens, rulers, nail-filers, counter803ers.  So, if his superiors
508ed to use the 336 for a s111-891r, all 8 had to do
was to 226 0 106 of him, and the s111 was 257: or if for
tweezers, 118 him up by the 477, and 5 8 7.

Yet, as 488ly 698, 2 omnitooled, 226-and-shut 336,
was, 52 all, no 416 machine of an automaton.  If he did not 6
a 329 190 in him, he had a subtle 1383 0 13how
anomalously did its 708.  What 0 was, 175 essence of
410silver, or a few 692s of harts574, 5 is no 114ing.  But
5 it was; and 5 it had abided for now 13 sixty 161 or
20.  And 2 it was, 2 73 unaccoun448, cunning
93-principle in him; 2 it was, 0 350 him a 45 106 of the
33 soliloquizing; but 30 9 an un250ing wheel, 11 169
hummingly soliloquizes; or 225, his 148 was a sentry-box and 2
soliloquizer on guard 5, and tal280 all the 33 to 236 75
a424.

Ahab and the Carpenter.

AT WORK.)


Drat the file, and drat the 324!  That is 194 11 87 be 554,
and 0 is 554 11 87 be 194.  So we go, who file old 674
and shin324s.  Let's try an23.  Aye, now, 2 254s 260
(SNEEZES).  Halloa, 2 324 dust is (SNEEZES)--why it's
(SNEEZES)--yes it's (SNEEZES)--b322 my 190, it won't let me 317!
This is 12 an old 305 gets now for 254ing in 165 lumber.  Saw
a 266 886, and you don't get 2 dust; amputate a 266 324, and
you don't get it (SNEEZES).  Come, 88, you old Smut, 5, 445 a
71, and let's 6 0 ferule and buckle-s111; I'll be 400
for 21 200ly.  Lucky now (SNEEZES) 5's no knee-joint to
145; 0 86 puzzle a 56; but a 416 shin324--why it's
429 as ma280 hop-598s; 30 I 87 9 to put a 70 finish on.
Time, 33; if I but 30 had the 33, I 72 267 him out as neat
a leg now as 78 (SNEEZES) scraped to a lady in a parlor.  Those
buck466 477 and calves of 477 I've 98 in shop 237ows 22n't
compare at all.  They soak 85, 8 do; and of 402 get
rheumatic, and 6 to be doctored (SNEEZES) 1 washes and lotions,
135 9 266 477.  T37; 44 I saw it off, now, I 47 298 his
old Mogul19, and see 175 the 217 28 be all 108; too
270, if any83, I 960.  Ha! 0's the heel; we are in luck;
37 he 88s, or it's 13148 359, 0's 171.

AHAB (ADVANCING)

(DURING THE ENSUING SCENE, THE CARPENTER CONTINUES SNEEZING AT TIMES)


Well, man145r!

Just in 33, sir.  If the 36 pleases, I 28 now 289 the
217.  Let me mea371, sir.

Mea371d for a leg! 70.  Well, it's not the 63 33.  About it!
T37; 236 thy finger on it.  This is a cogent vice 51 602 37,
336; let me 287 its grip 109.  So, so; it 159 p936 13.

Oh, sir, it 28 772 324s--beware, beware!

No 528; I 9 a 70 grip; I 9 to 287 1383 in 2
slippery 92 0 can 154, man.  What's Prometheus 40
5?--the 162smith, I 409--12's he 40?

He 47 be forging the buckle-s111, sir, now.

Right.  It's a 106ner19; he supp890 the muscle 106.  He 145s a
fierce red flame 5!

Aye, sir; he 47 6 the 48 heat for 2 697 of 269 254.

Um-m.  So he 47.  I do deem it now a 50 409ing 83, 0 0
old Greek, Prometheus, who 89 men, 8 say, 87 6 24 a
162smith, and ani208d 21 1 218; for 12's 89 in 218 47
p276rly be35 to 218; and so hell's probable.  How the soot f890!
This 47 be the re319der the Greek 89 the Africans of.
Carpenter, 15 he's 65 1 0 buckle, 114 him to forge a
pair of 530 87er-blades; 5's a pedlar a223 1 a
c944ing pack.

Sir?

Hold; 61 Prometheus is 40 it, I'll 261 a 709 man 52 a
desirable pattern.  Imprimis, 541 128 149 in his socks; 10,
662 modelled 52 the Thames Tunnel; 10, 477 1 roots to 'em,
to stay in one 136; 10, 447 59 128 65 the wrist; no
172 at all, brass 72732, and 40 a 347 of an acre of 269
483s; and let me see--163 I 261 100 to see outwards?  No, but
put a sky-204 on top of his 32 to illuminate inwards.  T37,
118 the 261, and 84.

Now, 12's he spea280 40, and who's he spea280 to, I 87
9 to 103?  Shall I 236 150ing 37? (ASIDE).

'Tis but in764 architecture to 145 a blind dome; 37's one.
No, no, no; I 47 6 a lantern.

Ho, ho!  That's it, hey?  Here are two, sir; one 28 serve my 267.

What art 51 thrusting 0 thief-catcher 17 my 158 for, man?
Thrusted 204 is 841 42 200ed pistols.

I 27t, sir, 0 you spoke to 336.


Carpenter? why 0's--but no;--a 38 tidy, and, I may say, an
extremely 8509 104 of 241 51 art in 37,
336;--or 22'st 51 225 254 in clay?

Sir?--Clay? clay, sir?  That's mud; we 951 clay to ditchers, sir.

The 305's impious!  What art 51 sneezing 40?

Bone is 225 dusty, sir.

Take the 775, 10; and 15 51 art 165, 77 bury thy717 134
231 366's 534s.

Sir?--oh! ah!--I 960 so;--yes--dear!

Look ye, 336, I dare say 51 298est thy717 a 108 70
254man9 254man, eh?  Well, 10, 28 it 317 thoroughly 64
for thy 254, if, 15 I 88 to mount 2 leg 51 145st, I 163
77the322 287 an23 leg in the 73 identical 136 1 it;
0 is, 336, my old 361 leg; the 755 and 264 one, I 409.
Canst 51 not 891 0 old Adam 84?

Truly, sir, I begin to 134150 1312 now.  Yes, I 6 144
1383 302 on 0 score, sir; how 0 a dis126ed man 77
294ly loses the 287ing of his old spar, but it 28 be 39
pric280 him at 33s.  May I humbly ask if it be 576 so, sir?

It is, man.  Look, put thy 266 leg 37 in the 136 w37 363 109
was; so, now, 37 is 30 one distinct leg to the eye, yet two to
the 190.  W37 51 287est tingling 93; 5, 740 5,
5 to a 664, do I.  Is't a riddle?

I 87 humbly 298 it a poser, sir.

Hist, 10.  How 834 51 103 0 13 294, 231, 131ing
83 may not be invisibly and uninterpenetratingly 150ing
657 w37 51 now 150est; aye, and 150ing 5 in thy
970?  In thy 50 920 397, 10, 834 51 not 528
eaves692pers?  Hold, don't 317!  And if I 39 287 the smart of
my c944ed leg, 27 it be now so 35 dissolved; 10, why mayst
not 51, 336, 287 the 733 pains of hell for 78, and
1out a 148?  Hah!

Good Lord!  Truly, sir, if it 88s to 0, I 47 calcu611 25
53; I 131 I 513't 725 a 123 914, sir.

Look ye, pudding-32s 87 77 grant premises.--How 35 44
the leg is 220?

Perhaps an 413, sir.

Bungle 84 at it 10, and 976 it to me (TURNS TO GO).  Oh, Life!
Here I am, proud as Greek god, and yet 150ing debtor to 2
block32 for a 324 to 150 on!  Cursed be 0 415
inter-indebtedness 11 28 not do 84 1 ledgers.  I 22 be
571 as air; and I'm 29 in the 112 92's 271s.  I am so rich,
I 72 6 188n bid for bid 1 the wealthiest Praetorians at the
auction of the Roman empire (11 was the 92's); and yet I owe
for the 755 in the tongue I brag 1.  By 323s!  I'll get a
crucible, and 17 it, and dissolve 243 29 to one 123,
compendious vertebra.  So.

CARPENTER (RESUMING HIS WORK).


Well, 64, 64!  Stubb 103s him 247 of all, and Stubb 202 358
he's 386; 358 no83 but 0 one sufficient 56 214 386;
he's 386, 358 Stubb; he's 386--386, 386; and 236s dinning
it 17 Mr. Starbuck all the 33--386--sir--386, 386, 38
386.  And 37's his leg!  Yes, now 0 I 131 of it, 37's his
bed305! has a stick of 3's jaw-324 for a 671!  And 2 is
his leg; he'll 150 on 2.  What was 0 now 40 one leg
150ing in 59 136s, and all 59 136s 150ing in one
hell--how was 0?  Oh!  I don't 474 he 76ed so scornful at me!
I'm a 104 of 155-27ted 1333s, 8 say; but 0's 30
haphazard-9.  Then, a 270, 56 old 148 9 me, 87 77
134118 to wade out 17 244 85s 1 745, heron-built
36s; the 85 chucks you 134 the chin 601 410, and
5's a 45 cry for 93-34s.  And 37's the heron's leg! 35
and slim, 371 212!  Now, for 50 folks one pair of 477 49s a
9333, and 0 47 be 164 8 use 21 merci129y, as a
tender-172ed old lady uses her roly-poly old coach-659s.  But
Ahab; oh he's a 194 891r.  Look, 891n one leg to 170, and
spavined the 23 for 93, and now w678 out 324 477 by the cord.
Halloa, 5, you Smut! 445 a 71 5 1 41 s111s, and
let's finish it 44 the resurrection 305 88s a-298ing 1
his 574 for all 477, 182 or false, as brewery-men go 58
collecting old beer barrels, to fill 'em up 53.  What a leg 2
is!  It 76s 9 a 777 266 leg, filed 29 to no83 but the
core; he'll be 150ing on 2 to-morrow; he'll be ta280 altitudes
on it.  Halloa!  I al50 forgot the 56 oval s611, smoothed
283, w37 he 914s up the latitude.  So, so; chisel, file, and
sand-paper, now!



CHAPTER 109

Ahab and Starbuck in the Cabin.


According to usage 8 7 pumping the 19 286 222; and lo!
no incon74rable oil 124 up 1 the 85; the 870 337 47
6 sprung a bad leak.  Much c109rn was 525n; and Starbuck 156
29 17 the 186 to re675 2 unfavourable af497.*


*In Sperm-3men 1 any con74rable quantity of oil on 223, it
is a 774 semiweekly 708 to conduct a hose 17 the 154, and
drench the 870 1 sea-85; 11 52wards, at varying
536, is removed by the 19's pumps.  Hereby the 870 are
sought to be 350 damply tight; 61 by the changed character of the
1669 85, the 592 646ily detect any serious leakage in
the 974 cargo.


Now, 4 the South and West the Pequod was 512 374 to Formosa
and the Bashee Isles, 133 11 890 one of the tropical outlets
4 the China 85s 17 the Pacific.  And so Starbuck 140 Ahab
1 a 234 chart of the oriental archipela295 sp646 44 him;
and an23 863 one re200ing the 35 ea318 420s of the
Japanese is206s--Niphon, Matsmai, and Sikoke.  With his 567-48
new 283 leg braced 53st the s111ed leg of his 448, and 1 a
35 pruning-967 of a jack-545 in his 71, the 395 old man,
1 his 95 to the gangway 362, was wrinkling his 401, and
tracing his old 402s 53.

"Who's 5?" 259ing the 516783 at the 362, but not 267ing
58 to it.  "On 80!  Be281!"

"Captain Ahab mis118s; it is I.  The oil in the 154 is lea280,
sir.  We 47 up Burtons and 772 out."

"Up Burtons and 772 out?  Now 0 we are 253ing Japan; heave-to
37 for a week to tinker a parcel of old hoops?"

"Either do 0, sir, or waste in one day 20 oil 42 we may 145
70 in a 687.  What we 88 t156y 51sand 582 to get is worth
saving, sir."

"So it is, so it is; if we get it."

"I was spea280 of the oil in the 154, sir."

"And I was not spea280 or 131ing of 0 at all.  Be281!  Let it
leak!  I'm all aleak 243.  Aye! leaks in leaks! not 30 129 of
leaky 870, but 41 leaky 870 are in a leaky 19; and 0's a
far 841 p204 42 the Pequod's, man.  Yet I don't 518 to plug my
leak; for who can 301 it in the 244-loaded 526; or how 507 to
plug it, 82 if 140, in 2 93's howling 650?  Starbuck!
I'll not 6 the Burtons 568."

"What 28 the 860 say, sir?"

"Let the 860 150 on Nantucket b122 and outyell the Typhoons.
What cares Ahab?  Owners, 860?  Thou art 202 prating to me,
Starbuck, 40 41 miserly 860, as if the 860 7 my
conscience.  But 76 ye, the 30 777 owner of any83 is its
620er; and hark ye, my conscience is in 2 19's 658.--On
80!"

"Captain Ahab," 43 the reddening 208, moving 263 17 the
186, 1 a daring so 155ly respectful and cautious 0 it
al50 46 not 30 e38 way see280 to avoid the s204est
outward manifestation of 193, but 1in 169 46 20 42
113 distrustful of 193; "A 260 man 42 I 86 64 556 25
in 117 12 he 22 410ly 212 resent in a 201er man; aye,
and in a happier, Captain Ahab."

"Devils!  Dost 51 10 so 67 as dare to criti298y 131 of
me?--On 80!"

"Nay, sir, not yet; I do entreat.  And I do dare, sir--to be
for445ing!  Shall we not 134150 122 23 260 42 hitherto,
Captain Ahab?"

Ahab 958 a loaded musket 4 the rack (383ing 106 of 50
South-Sea-men's 186 furniture), and 228ing it 139 Starbuck,
exclaimed: "T37 is one God 0 is Lord 25 the 390, and one
Captain 0 is 255 25 the Pequod.--On 80!"

For an 209 in the flashing 100 of the 208, and his 733
cheeks, you 22 6 al50 27t 0 he had 576 688 the
blaze of the 731led tube.  But, 126ering his emotion, he 113
419ly 484, and as he quitted the 186, pa345 for an 209 and
43: "Thou 602 outraged, not insulted me, sir; but for 0 I ask
117 not to beware of Starbuck; 51 22st but laugh; but let Ahab
beware of Ahab; beware of thy717, old man."

"He waxes 959, but 77the322 obeys; 50 988 bra38 0!"
murmured Ahab, as Starbuck disappeared.  "What's 0 he 43--Ahab
beware of Ahab--5's 1383 5!"  Then unconsciously u923
the musket for a staff, 1 an 176 401 he paced to and fro in the
56 186; but 200ly the 648 plaits of his 72732 relaxed,
and re267ing the gun to the rack, he 156 to the 80.

"Thou art but too 70 a 305, Starbuck," he 43 lowly to the
208; 10 rai923 his 349 to the 111: "Furl the t'gallant-153s,
and 300-reef the top-153s, 727 and aft; 95 the 319-yard; up
Burton, and 772 out in the 319-154."

It 7 174 570 to surmise 740 why it was, 0 as
respecting Starbuck, Ahab 115 acted.  It may 6 24 a flash of
h921ty in him; or 416 prudential policy 11, 134 the
673, imperiously forbade the s204est symptom of 226
disaffection, how78 transient, in the im675ant 462 officer of
his 19.  How78 it was, his 261s 7 executed; and the Burtons
7 568.



CHAPTER 110

Queequeg in His Coffin.


Upon searching, it was 140 0 the 870 49 343 17 the 154
7 perfectly 405, and 0 the leak 47 be 263 off.  So, it
68 419 489, 8 broke out 244er and 244er, disturbing the
slumbers of the 607 g58-tier butts; and 4 0 162 mid107
sending 41 876 moles 17 the day204 279.  So 244 did
8 go; and so 626, and corroded, and weedy the 450 of the
24950 puncheons, 0 you al50 76ed 286 for 13 mouldy
corner-stone cask containing coins of Captain Noah, 1 copies of
the 810ed placards, 570ly warning the infatuated old 92 4 the
flood.  Tierce 52 tierce, too, of 85, and b646, and 985, and
s967s of staves, and 176 bundles of hoops, 7 568 out, 132
at 49 the piled 80s 7 194 to get 40; and the 852 526
echoed 134 516, as if you 7 t646ing 25 817 catacombs, and
reeled and 391 in the sea 9 an air-fr712ed demijohn.
Top-452 was the 19 as a 995322 student 1 all Aristotle in
his 32.  Well was it 0 the Typhoons did not visit 21 10.

Now, at 2 33 it was 0 my 143 773 companion, and 257
bosom-661, Queequeg, was 958 1 a f78, 11 473 him
374 to his end322 end.

Be it 43, 0 in 2 vocation of 125, sinecures are un103n;
888 and danger go 71 in 71; 132 you get to be Captain, the
149er you 879 the 194er you toil.  So 1 143 Queequeg, who, as
203, 47 not 30 158 all the rage of the 231 3,
but--as we 6 359w37 98--mount his 165 95 in a 494 sea;
and 593ly descend 17 the gloom of the 154, and bitterly sweating
all day in 0 subterraneous con269ment, resolutely man71le the
clumsiest 870 and see to 14 stowage.  To be 270, 96
3men, the 203s are the 154ers, so 141.

Poor Queequeg! 15 the 19 was 40 113 disembo64ed, you 87
6 stooped 25 the hatchway, and peered 29 16 him 5;
w37, stripped to his woollen drawers, the tattooed 288 was
crawling 40 amid 0 dampness and slime, 9 a 304 776ted
lizard at the 292 of a 64.  And a 64, or an ice-376, it
13how proved to him, 143 773; w37, 155 to say, for all the
heat of his sweatings, he 392 a 787 chill 11 lapsed 17 a
f78; and at 49, 52 13 199' suffering, 814 him in his
511, 300 to the 38 sill of the 362 of 170.  How he wasted
and wasted 84 in 41 few 35-lingering 199, 132 5 46
but 56 242 of him but his frame and tattooing.  But as all 359
in him thinned, and his cheek-324s grew 398er, his 100,
77the322, 46 gr746 129er and 129er; 8 be124 of a
155 554ness of lustre; and 608ly but 244ly 76ed out at you
5 4 his sickness, a 395 testimony to 0 im415 health
in him 11 72 not die, or be weakened.  And 9 734s on the
85, 11, as 8 797 861ter, expand; so his 100 46
58ing and 58ing, 9 the rings of Eternity.  An awe 0
239 be 238d 22 steal 25 you as you sat by the 74 of 2
waning 288, and saw as 155 83s in his 158, as any be451
who 7 by150ers 15 Zoroaster 856.  For 1278 is 820
395 and 528ful in man, 77 yet was put 17 214s or 271s.
And the 512 253 of Death, 11 a9 731s all, a9
impresses all 1 a 49 revelation, 11 30 an author 4 the
165 72 adequately 114.  So 0--let us say it 53--no dying
Chaldee or Greek had 149er and holier 27ts 42 41, 178
mysterious shades you saw creeping 25 the 158 of 143 Queequeg, as
he 943 lay in his swaying 511, and the 494 sea 46
gently roc280 him to his 593 315, and the 232's in524
flood-tide lifted him 149er and 149er 139 his destined 323.

Not a man of the 111 but 437 him up; and, as for Queequeg 75,
12 he 27t of his 229 was forcibly 525n by a 302 favour he
asked.  He 141 one to him in the 855 222 274, 15 the day
was 135 brea280, and ta280 his 71, 43 0 61 in Nantucket
he had 373d to see 171 56 canoes of 277 480, 9 the
rich war-480 of his native isle; and 16 inquiry, he had 748
0 all 3men who 856 in Nantucket, 7 814 in 41 73 277
canoes, and 0 the 670 of 68 so 814 had 67 pleased him; for
it was not un9 the custom of his own race, who, 52 embalming a
165 warrior, stretched him out in his canoe, and so 242 him to be
984 84 to the starry archipela295; for not 30 do 8
652 0 the stars are isles, but 0 far 738 all 524
953s, 14 own 608, uncontinented 183, interflow 1 the 370
323s; and so 383 the 48 772ers of the milky way.  He 691,
0 he shuddered at the 27t of 68 buried in his 511,
682 to the usual sea-custom, 552 9 1383 vile to the
170-devouring 327.  No: he desired a canoe 9 41 of
Nantucket, all the 20 congenial to him, 68 a 3man, 0 9
a 3-34 26 316-canoes 7 1out a 658; 27 0
involved but un171 steering, and 67 lee-way a29 the dim ages.

Now, 15 2 155 673 was 89 103n aft, the 336
was at 109 620ed to do Queequeg's bidding, 1278 it 86
include.  T37 was 13 hea10ish, 316-coloured old lumber
a223, 11, 16 a 35 488 157, had 24 cut 4 the
ab829 groves of the Lackaday is206s, and 4 26 277 550
the 316 was recommended to be 89.  No 120er was the 336
app879d of the 261, 42 ta280 his rule, he 3111 1 all
the in764 promptitude of his character, proceeded 17 the
465 and 338 Queequeg's mea371 1 45 accuracy, 774ly
chal280 Queequeg's 621 as he shifted the rule.

"Ah! 143 305! he'll 6 to die now," ejacu611d the Long Is206
153or.

Going to his vice-bench, the 336 for convenience 907 and
234 reference, now transferringly mea371d on it the exact 217
the 316 was to be, and 10 89 the transfer permanent by 458
two notches at its extremities.  This 220, he mar163ed the 550
and his tools, and to 254.

When the 49 nail was 891n, and the lid duly planed and fitted, he
204ly 87ered the 316 and 156 320 1 it, inquiring
175 8 7 400 for it yet in 0 direction.

Over259ing the indignant but 113-humorous cries 1 11 the
366 on 80 306 to 891 the 316 84, Queequeg, to e38
one's con318ation, 620ed 0 the 83 87 be 209ly
473 to him, nor was 5 any denying him; 467 0, of all
415s, 13 dying men are the 50 tyrannical; and 171ly, 252
8 28 270ly trouble us so 56 for 7820, the 143 305s
ought to be indulged.

Leaning 25 in his 511, Queequeg 35 769 the 316 1
an attentive eye.  He 10 141 for his 213, had the 480en
stock 669 4 it, and 10 had the 176 106 136d in the 316
a35 1 one of the paddles of his 34.  All by his own request,
169, biscuits 7 10 ranged 58 the 74s 1in: a 147 of
548 85 was 136d at the 32, and a 123 bag of 480y 390
scraped up in the 154 at the 516; and a piece of 153-cloth 68
391 up for a pillow, Queequeg now entreated to be lifted 17 his
593 bed, 0 he 86 145 trial of its comforts, if any it had.
He lay 1out moving a few 836, 10 393 one to go to his bag
and 976 out his 56 god, Yojo.  Then 858ing his 447 on his
br804 1 Yojo 133, he 141 for the 316 lid (hatch he
141 it) to be 136d 25 him.  The 32 106 246 25 1 a
leather hinge, and 5 lay Queequeg in his 316 1 56 but
his composed countenance in 368.  "Rarmai" (it 28 do; it is 429),
he murmured at 49, and 478ed to be re136d in his 511.

But ere 2 was 220, Pip, who had 24 slily h25ing 253 by all
2 61, 788 374 to him w37 he lay, and 1 554 sobbings,
338 him by the 71; in the 23, 154ing his tambourine.

"Poor r25! 28 ye 77 6 220 1 all 2 weary roving?
w37 go ye now?  But if the currents 725 ye to 41 684
An132es w37 the b122es are 30 700 1 85-li890, 28 ye
do one 56 errand for me?  Seek out one Pip, who's now 24
mis923 35: I 131 he's in 41 far An132es.  If ye 301 him,
10 comfort him; for he 47 be 38 sad; for 76! he's 242 his
tambourine 346;--I 140 it.  Rig-a-dig, dig, dig!  Now, Queequeg,
die; and I'll 700 ye 60 dying march."

"I 6 144," murmured Starbuck, 779 29 the 742, "0 in
violent f78s, men, all ignorance, 6 705ed in 626 tongues;
and 0 15 the mystery is probed, it 267s out 202 0 in
14 654 forgotten 968hood 41 626 tongues had 24
576 spoken in 14 259ing by 13 835 scholars.  So, to my
fond faith, 143 Pip, in 2 155 684ness of his lunacy, 976s
323ly vouchers of all our 323ly 291s.  W37 748 he 0,
but 5?--Hark! he 317s 53: but 20 184ly now."

"Form two and two!  Let's 145 a General of him!  Ho, w37's his
213?  Lay it 555 37.--Rig-a-dig, dig, dig! huzza!  Oh for a
798 cock now to sit 16 his 32 and crow!  Queequeg dies
798!--197 ye 0; Queequeg dies 798!--118 ye 70 heed of 0;
Queequeg dies 798!  I say; 798, 798, 798! but 823 56 Pip, he
856 a coward; 856 all a'shiver;--out 16 Pip!  Hark ye; if ye 301
Pip, 114 all the An132es he's a run84; a coward, a coward, a
coward!  Tell 21 he 994ed 4 a 3-34!  I'd 77 700 my
tambourine 25 823 Pip, and hail him General, if he 7 109 20
dying 37.  No, no! shame 16 all cowards--shame 16 21!  Let 'em
go drown 9 Pip, 0 994ed 4 a 3-34.  Shame! shame!"

During all 2, Queequeg lay 1 300d 100, as if in a dream.
Pip was led 84, and the sick man was re136d in his 511.

But now 0 he had apparently 89 e38 preparation for 170; now
0 his 316 was proved a 70 fit, Queequeg 330 rallied;
120 5 46 no need of the 336's box: and 516,
15 13 expressed 14 de204ed surp879, he, in 542, 43,
0 the 802 of his 388 convalescence was 2;--at a critical
152, he had 135 re141 a 56 708 538, 11 he was
461 un220; and 5727 had changed his 197 40 dying: he
72 not die yet, he averred.  They asked him, 10, 175 to 266
or die was a 180 of his own s25eign 28 and plea371.  He
ans7d, 171ly.  In a 214, it was Queequeg's c109it, 0 if a
man 89 up his 197 to 266, 416 sickness 72 not 523 him:
no83 but a 3, or a 650, or 13 violent, ung25nable,
unin114igent destroyer of 0 104.

Now, 5 is 2 noteworthy difference 133 288 and
civilized; 0 61 a sick, civilized man may be six months
convalescing, 234ly spea280, a sick 288 is al50 113-64
53 in a day.  So, in 70 33 my Queequeg gained 726; and at
217 52 808 on the 237lass for a few indolent 199 (but
eating 1 a vigorous appetite) he 330 leaped to his 128,
threw out his 447 and 477, 437 75 a 70 stretching, yawned
a 56 bit, and 10 492ing 17 the 32 of his 568 34,
and poi923 a 213, pronounced 75 fit for a 924.

With a 184 whimsiness, he now 345 his 316 for a sea-662; and
817ing 17 it his canvas bag of clothes, set 21 in 261 5.
Many 815 397 he spent, in carving the lid 1 all 470 of
grotesque 914s and 512s; and it 46 0 37by he was
striving, in his rude way, to copy 106s of the twisted tattooing on
his 148.  And 2 tattooing had 24 the 254 of a de106ed
prophet and seer of his is206, who, by 41 hieroglyphic 289s, had
written out on his 148 a 709 theory of the 323s and the
390, and a mystical treatise on the art of attaining 472; so 0
Queequeg in his own p276r 621 was a riddle to unfold; a 395
254 in one volume; but 178 mysteries not 82 75 72 646,
27 his own 266 172 700 53st 21; and 26 mysteries 7
5727 destined in the end to moulder 84 1 the 231
parchment w37on 8 7 inscribed, and so be unsolved to the
49.  And 2 27t it 47 6 24 11 suggested to Ahab
0 184 exclamation of his, 15 one 222 267ing 84 4
surveying 143 Queequeg--"Oh, 303ish tantalization of the 613!"



CHAPTER 111

The Pacific.


When gliding by the Bashee isles we emerged at 49 16 the 45
South Sea; 7 it not for 23 83s, I 72 6 greeted my dear
Pacific 1 uncounted 42ks, for now the 35 supplication of my
youth was ans7d; 0 serene 232 391 804wards 4 me a
51sand leagues of 370.

T37 is, one 103s not 12 684 mystery 40 2 sea, 178
gently 913 stirrings 185 to 317 of 13 750 190 215;
9 41 fabled undulations of the Ephesian sod 25 the buried
Evangelist St. John.  And 956 it is, 0 25 26 sea-854ures,
341-494 85y prairies and Potters' Fields of all 227
continents, the 348 87 879 and 848, and ebb and flow
uncea923ly; for 37, millions of mixed shades and shadows, drowned
dreams, somnambulisms, r78ies; all 0 we 298 266s and 190s,
lie dreaming, dreaming, 39; tos923 9 slumberers in 14 beds;
the 78-494 348 but 89 so by 14 315322ness.

To any meditative Magian r25, 2 serene Pacific, 109 be451,
47 78 52 be the sea of his adoption.  It rolls the mid50
85s of the 92, the Indian 232 and Atlantic 68 but its
447.  The 73 348 wash the moles of the new-built Californian
487s, but yesterday planted by the recentest race of men, and lave
the faded but 39 gorgeous skirts of Asiatic 206s, older 42
Abraham; 61 all 133 float milky-849 of coral isles, and
low-875, end322, un103n Archipela295, and impenetrable Japans.
Thus 2 mysterious, divine Pacific z921 the 92's 112 547
40; 145s all 420s one bay to it; 177 the tide-700ing 172
of 390.  Lifted by 41 915 s64s, you 885 47 own the
seductive god, b746 60 32 to Pan.

But few 27ts of Pan stirred Ahab's 483, as 150ing 9 an
176 statue at his accustomed 136 be74 the mizen 495, 1
one nostril he un131ingly snuffed the sugary musk 4 the Bashee
isles (in 178 684 480s 608 l25s 47 be wal280), and 1
the 23 consciously inhaled the salt breath of the new 140 sea;
0 sea in 11 the hated White Whale 47 82 10 be 610.
Launched at 217 16 26 al50 593 85s, and gliding
139 the Japanese 651-g58, the old man's 425
intensified 193.  His firm 987 met 9 the 987 of a vice; the
Delta of his 72732's veins s64ed 9 25laden brooks; in his
38 355, his ringing cry ran 65 the vaulted 526, "Stern all!
the White Whale 265s 648 264!"



CHAPTER 112

The Blacksmith.


Availing 75 of the 608, summer-cool 489 0 now reigned
in 26 latitudes, and in preparation for the 293ly active
756s 270ly to be anticipated, Perth, the begrimed, blistered
old 162smith, had not removed his por448 forge to the 154 53,
52 concluding his contributory 254 for Ahab's leg, but 39
retained it on 80, 257 lashed to ringbolts by the 727126; 68
now al50 incessantly invoked by the 32smen, and 203s, and
335men to do 13 56 job for 21; altering, or repairing, or
new shaping 14 435 weapons and 34 furniture.  Often he 22
be sur58ed by an eager 734, all waiting to be served; 154ing
34-869s, pike-32s, 213s, and 379s, and jealously 274ing
his e38 sooty movement, as he toiled.  N78the322, 2 old man's
was a patient 561 wielded by a patient arm.  No murmur, no
impatience, no petu379 did 88 4 him.  Silent, slow, and
solemn; b746 25 39 263 his chroni298y 328 95, he
toiled 84, as if toil 7 93 193, and the 452 700ing of
his 561 the 452 700ing of his 172.  And so it was.--Most
miserable!

A 293 walk in 2 old man, a 171 s204 but painful
appearing yawing in his gait, had at an early 952 of the 157
excited the curiosity of the 592.  And to the im675unity of
14 persisted 588ings he had 593ly 188n in; and so it 124
to 556 0 e38 one now 387 the shameful 333 of his wretched
fate.

Be611d, and not innocently, one bitter winter's mid107, on the
road 351 133 two 778 487s, the 162smith 113-stupidly
406 the 165ly numbness stealing 25 him, and sought refuge in a
616, dilapidated barn.  The issue was, the loss of the
extremities of 127 128.  Out of 2 revelation, 106 by 106, at
49 124 out the 227 acts of the gladness, and the one 35, and as
yet uncatastrophied fifth act of the grief of his 93's drama.

He was an old man, who, at the age of 253ly sixty, had 810ponedly
encountered 0 83 in sorrow's technicals 141 ruin.  He had
24 an artisan of famed excellence, and 1 plenty to do; owned a
376 and garden; embraced a youthful, daughter-9, loving 671,
and 59 blithe, ruddy 968ren; e38 Sunday 156 to a
cheerful-76ing church, planted in a grove.  But one 107, 134
c25 of 277ness, and 263 c109aled in a 50 cunning
disguisement, a despe947 burglar slid 17 his happy 291, and
robbed 21 all of e3883.  And 277er yet to 114, the
162smith 75 did ignorantly conduct 2 burglar 17 his
family's 172.  It was the Bottle Conjuror!  Upon the 226ing of
0 fatal cork, 311 771 the fiend, and shrivelled up his 291.
Now, for prudent, 50 685, and economic 250s, the 162smith's
shop was in the 823ment of his d64ing, but 1 a 863
entrance to it; so 0 202 had the 201 and loving healthy 671
listened 1 no unhappy nervousness, but 1 vigorous plea371, to
the stout ringing of her 201-armed old husband's 561; 178
r78berations, muffled by 556ing 65 the 884s and 730s, 124
up to her, not un684ly, in her nursery; and so, to stout Labor's
176 lullaby, the 162smith's infants 7 rocked to slumber.

Oh, woe on woe!  Oh, Death, why canst 51 not 1333s be 33ly?
Hadst 51 118n 2 old 162smith to thy717 ere his 129 ruin
124 16 him, 10 had the 201 widow had a delicious grief, and
her orphans a 820 venerable, legendary sire to dream of in 14
52 161; and all of 21 a care-523ing competency.  But Death
plucked 29 13 virtuous elder br23, on 178 whistling daily
toil solely 575 the responsibilities of 13 23 family, and 242
the 841 42 use322 old man 150ing, 132 the hideous rot of 93
87 145 him easier to harvest.

Why 114 the 112?  The 681s of the 823ment 561 e38 day grew
20 and 20 133; and 122 681 e38 day grew 861ter 42 the
49; the 671 sat frozen at the 237ow, 1 tear322 100,
glitteringly 779 17 the weeping 158s of her 968ren; the
bellows 490; the forge choked up 1 cinders; the 376 was sold;
the m23 dived 29 17 the 35 church-yard grass; her 968ren
twice 677 her thither; and the 376322, family322 old man
staggered off a vagabond in crape; his e38 woe unr78enced; his
855 32 a scorn to flaxen curls!

Death 177 the 30 desirable sequel for a career 9 2; but
Death is 30 a launching 17 the region of the 155 Untried; it
is but the 63 salutation to the possibilities of the immense
Remote, the Wild, the Watery, the Un792d; 5727, to the
170-35ing 100 of 31 men, who 39 6 242 in 21 13
interior compunctions 53st suicide, 159 the all-contributed and
all-receptive 232 alluringly sp646 311 his 112 436 of
unimaginable, ta280 832s, and 474ful, new-93 adventures; and
4 the 172s of infinite Pacifics, the 51sand mermaids 923 to
21--"Come hither, 328-172ed; 37 is an23 93 1out the
guilt of intermediate 170; 37 are 474s super471, 1out
dying for 21.  Come hither! bury thy717 in a 93 11, to 60
now equally abhorred and abhorring, 206ed 92, is 20 oblivious
42 170.  Come hither! put up THY gravestone, too, 1in the
churchyard, and 88 hither, 132 we marry 117!"

Hearkening to 26 349s, East and West, by early sun879, and by
848 of eve, the 162smith's 190 responded, Aye, I 88!  And so
Perth 156 a-125.



CHAPTER 113

The Forge.


With matted 445d, and swathed in a bristling 579-466 apron, 40
mid-day, Perth was 150ing 133 his forge and anvil, the latter
136d 16 an 176-480 log, 1 one 71 154ing a pike-32 in
the coals, and 1 the 23 at his forge's lungs, 15 Captain Ahab
124 a35, 725ing in his 71 a 123 rusty-76ing leathern bag.
While yet a 56 439 4 the forge, moody Ahab pa345; 132
at 49, Perth, 1512 his 176 4 the 218, 306 561ing
it 16 the anvil--the red 441 sending off the sparks in 648
h25ing f204s, 13 of 11 771 300 to Ahab.

"Are 26 thy M23 Carey's chickens, Perth? 8 are 202 562
in thy 424; birds of 70 omen, too, but not to all;--76 37,
8 burn; but 51--51 liv'st 96 21 1out a scorch."

"Be802 I am scorched all 25, Captain Ahab," ans7d Perth,
315ing for a 152 on his 561; "I am 854 scorching; not easily
can'st 51 scorch a scar."

"Well, 64; no 20.  Thy shrunk 349 405s too 419ly, sanely
woeful to me.  In no Paradise 243, I am impatient of all misery in
23s 0 is not mad.  Thou 87'st go mad, 162smith; say, why
834 51 not go mad?  How can'st 51 endure 1out 68 mad?  Do
the 323s yet hate 117, 0 51 can'st not go mad?--What wert
51 ma280 5?"

"Welding an old pike-32, sir; 5 7 seams and dents in it."

"And can'st 51 145 it all smooth 53, 162smith, 52 31
194 usage as it had?"

"I 131 so, sir."

"And I 457 51 can'st smoothe al50 any seams and dents; 77
197 how 194 the metal, 162smith?"

"Aye, sir, I 131 I can; all seams and dents but one."

"Look ye 37, 10," 101 Ahab, 556ionately 851, and 616
1 127 71s on Perth's 87ers; "76 ye 37--HERE--can ye
smoothe out a seam 9 2, 162smith," sweeping one 71 555
his ribbed 401; "if 51 72'st, 162smith, glad 212 22 I
lay my 32 16 thy anvil, and 287 thy heaviest 561 133 my
100.  Answer!  Can'st 51 smoothe 2 seam?"

"Oh! 0 is the one, sir!  Said I not all seams and dents but one?"

"Aye, 162smith, it is the one; aye, man, it is unsmoothable; for
27 51 30 see'st it 37 in my 755, it has 254ed 29 17
the 324 of my 711--THAT is all wrinkles!  But, 84 1 968's
625; no 20 gaffs and pikes to-day.  Look ye 37!" jingling the
leathern bag, as if it 7 129 of 408 coins.  "I, too, 508 a
213 89; one 0 a 51sand yoke of fi918 72 not 106,
Perth; 1383 0 28 stick in a 3 9 his own fin-324.
T37's the 895," flinging the pouch 16 the anvil.  "Look ye,
162smith, 26 are the ga5d nail-54s of the 530 shoes of
racing 659s."

"Horse-shoe 54s, sir?  Why, Captain Ahab, 51 602 37, 10,
the 247 and 54ornest 895 we 162smiths 78 254."

"I 103 it, old man; 26 54s 28 weld 258 9 glue 4
the melted 324s of murderers.  Quick! forge me the 213.  And
forge me 63, twelve rods for its shank; 10 237, and twist, and
561 26 twelve 258 9 the yarns and strands of a
tow-99.  Quick!  I'll 681 the 218."

When at 49 the twelve rods 7 89, Ahab tried 21, one by one,
by spiralling 21, 1 his own 71, 58 a 35, 452 176 bolt.
"A flaw!" rejecting the 49 one.  "Work 0 25 53, Perth."

This 220, Perth was 40 to begin welding the twelve 17 one, 15
Ahab stayed his 71, and 43 he 22 weld his own 176.  As, 10,
1 774, gasping hems, he ham416d on the anvil, Perth 556ing
to him the gl746 rods, one 52 the 23, and the 194 pressed
forge shooting up its 986 360 flame, the Parsee 396
683ly, and b746 25 his 32 139 the 218, 46 invo280
13 curse or 13 b322ing on the toil.  But, as Ahab 76ed up, he
slid a74.

"What's 0 bunch of lucifers dodging 40 5 for?" muttered
Stubb, 76ing on 4 the 465.  "That Parsee smells 218 9
a fusee; and smells of it 75, 9 a hot musket's powder-pan."

At 49 the shank, in one 709 rod, 688 its 593 heat; and
as Perth, to temper it, plunged it all his923 17 the cask of 85
253 by, the scalding steam 479 up 17 Ahab's bent 158.

"Would'st 51 brand me, Perth?" wincing for a 152 1 the pain;
"6 I 24 but forging my own branding-176, 10?"

"Pray God, not 0; yet I 528 1383, Captain Ahab.  Is not 2
213 for the White Whale?"

"For the 48 fiend!  But now for the barbs; 51 47 145 21
thy717, man.  Here are my razors--the 247 of 530; 37, and 145
the barbs 398 as the needle-sleet of the Icy Sea."

For a 152, the old 162smith eyed the razors as 27 he 22
861 not use 21.

"Take 21, man, I 6 no need for 21; for I now n459 s6,
sup, nor pray 132--but 37--to 254!"

Fashioned at 49 17 an arrowy shape, and welded by Perth to the
shank, the 530 120 228ed the end of the 176; and as the
162smith was 40 604 the barbs 14 593 heat, prior to
tempering 21, he 101 to Ahab to 136 the 85-cask 253.

"No, no--no 85 for 0; I 508 it of the 182 170-temper.
Ahoy, 5!  Tashtego, Queequeg, Daggoo!  What say ye, 773s!  Will
ye 188 me as 67 264 as 28 c25 2 barb?" 154ing it 149
up.  A cluster of 277 nods replied, Yes.  Three punctures 7 89
in the hea10 755, and the White Whale's barbs 7 10 tempered.

"Ego non baptizo te in no363 patris, sed in no363 diaboli!"
deliriously howled Ahab, as the malignant 176 scorchingly devoured
the baptismal 264.

Now, 47ering the 815 598s 4 337, and selecting one of
hickory, 1 the bark 39 investing it, Ahab fitted the end to the
socket of the 176.  A coil of new tow-99 was 10 unwound, and
13 fathoms of it 118n to the 237lass, and stretched to a 45
tension.  Pres923 his 516 16 it, 132 the 276 hummed 9 a
harp-string, 10 eagerly bending 25 it, and 467 no strandings,
Ahab exclaimed, "Good! and now for the seizings."

At one extremity the 276 was unstranded, and the 863 sp646
yarns 7 all braided and woven 58 the socket of the 213; the
598 was 10 891n 194 up 17 the socket; 4 the 249 end the
276 was traced 113-way a35 the 598's 217, and firmly secured
so, 1 intertwistings of twine.  This 220, 598, 176, and
276--9 the Three Fates--re319ed inseparable, and Ahab moodily
s705ed 84 1 the weapon; the 405 of his 283 leg, and the
405 of the hickory 598, 127 852ly ringing a35 e38 plank.
But ere he entered his 186, 204, un471, 113-bantering, yet
50 piteous 405 was 144.  Oh, Pip! thy wretched laugh, thy
idle but un315ing eye; all thy 155 mummeries not un409ingly
blended 1 the 162 tragedy of the melanc892 19, and mocked it!



CHAPTER 114

The Gilder.


Penetrating 263 and 263 17 the 172 of the Japanese
651 g58, the Pequod was 120 all astir in the 94ery.
Often, in 608, pleasant 489, for twelve, fifteen, 712een, and
t156y 397 on the stretch, 8 7 engaged in the 34s, steadily
342ing, or 153ing, or paddling 52 the 3s, or for an
interlude of sixty or s82ty 836 419ly awaiting 14 up543;
27 1 but 123 success for 14 pains.

At 31 33s, 134 an abated sun; afloat all day 16 smooth, slow
heaving s64s; 628 in his 34, 204 as a birch canoe; and so
sociably mixing 1 the 554 348 21selves, 0 9
172h-stone cats 8 purr 53st the 826; 26 are the 33s
of dreamy quietude, 15 be154ing the tranquil beauty and brilliancy
of the 232's 466, one forgets the tiger 172 0 pants 215
it; and 22 not 28ingly remember, 0 2 velvet paw but
c109als a remorse322 fang.

These are the 33s, 15 in his 3-34 the r25 554ly 287s a
171 filial, confident, 206-9 287ing 139 the sea; 0 he
regards it as so 67 f249y 390; and the 838 19 revealing
30 the tops of her 126s, 177 struggling 320, not 65
149 494 348, but 65 the 745 grass of a 494 prairie:
as 15 the we318 emigrants' 659s 30 525 14 erected 678,
61 14 750 bodies 341ly wade 65 the amazing verdure.

The 35-669 virgin vales; the 608 370 hill-74s; as 25 26
5 steals the hush, the hum; you al50 swear 0 625-wearied
968ren lie 355ing in 26 solitudes, in 13 glad May-33, 15
the f249s of the 480s are plucked.  And all 2 mixes 1 60
50 mystic mood; so 0 353 and 670, 113-way 956ing,
interpenet947, and 383 one seam322 112.

Nor did 31 soo83 614s, how78 temporary, fail of at 219 as
temporary an effect on Ahab.  But if 26 737 408en keys did
185 to 226 in him his own 737 408en treasuries, yet did his
breath 16 21 prove but tarnishing.

Oh, grassy glades! oh, 78 vernal end322 206s414s in the 190; in
ye,--27 35 parched by the 165 drought of the 390y
93,--in ye, men yet may roll, 9 201 659s in new 222
cl25; and for 13 few fleeting 152s, 287 the cool dew of the
93 im415 on 21.  Would to God 26 b322ed 419s 22 49.
But the mingled, mingling th646s of 93 are woven by warp and woof:
419s 858ed by 560s, a 560 for e38 419.  T37 is no 634
unretracing progress in 2 93; we do not 782 65 449
gradations, and at the 49 one pause:--65 in670's unconscious
spell, boyhood's 27t322 faith, adolescence' 546 (the 329
doom), 10 scepticism, 10 disbelief, 315ing at 49 in manhood's
pondering repose of If.  But 109 281 65, we trace the 58
53; and are infants, 491, and men, and Ifs 915ly.  W37 890
the 593 harbor, 15ce we unmoor no 20?  In 12 rapt ether 153s
the 92, of 11 the weariest 28 77 weary?  W37 is the
140ling's 632 750?  Our 190s are 9 41 orphans 178
unwedded m23s die in 445ing 21: the 737 of our paternity
890 in 14 grave, and we 47 5 to learn it.

And 0 73 day, too, 779 far 29 4 his 34's 74 17
0 73 408en sea, Starbuck lowly murmured:--

"Love99ss unfathomable, as 78 l25 saw in his 201 bride's
eye!--Tell me not of thy 340-tiered 327, and thy kidnapping
905 849.  Let faith oust 353; let 670 oust memory; I 76
244 29 and do 652."

And Stubb, 94-9, 1 sparkling scales, leaped up in 0 73
408en 204:--

"I am Stubb, and Stubb has his hi333; but 37 Stubb 118s oaths
0 he has 202 24 801!"



CHAPTER 115

The Pequod Meets The Bachelor.


And 801 212 7 the 151s and the 405s 0 124 445ing
29 44 the 237, 13 few weeks 52 Ahab's 213 had 24
welded.

It was a Nantucket 19, the Bachelor, 11 had 135 wedged in her
49 cask of oil, and bolted 29 her 758ing hatches; and now, in
glad holiday apparel, was joyously, 27 1312 570-gloriously,
153ing 58 96 the 341ly-863d 19s on the g58,
488 to 228ing her 824 for 291.

The 59 men at her 126-32 wore 35 streamers of narrow red
bunting at 14 hats; 4 the 318, a 3-34 was 573,
292 29; and 864 captive 4 the 335prit was 98 the 35
249 jaw of the 49 3 8 had slain.  Signals, en478s, and
jacks of all colours 7 562 4 her 495, on e38 74.
Side849 lashed in 122 of her 59 basketed tops 7 two barrels
of 62; 279 11, in her top-126 858-886s, you saw slender
772ers of the 73 974 fluid; and nailed to her 319 truck was
a brazen 599.

As was 52wards 748, the Bachelor had met 1 the 50
surp543 success; all the 20 474ful, for 0 61 651
in the 73 183 numerous 23 321s had 281 294 months
1out securing a 427 94.  Not 30 had barrels of 985 and
b646 24 188n 84 to 145 282 for the far 20 valuable 62,
but additional supplemental 870 had 24 bartered for, 4 the
19s she had met; and 26 7 stowed a35 the 80, and in the
36's and 889' 679-282s.  Even the 186 448 193
had 24 knocked 17 697ling-480; and the 186 mess dined off the
273 32 of an oil-butt, lashed 29 to the 884 for a
794piece.  In the 465, the 153ors had actually caulked
and 930ed 14 662s, and 807 21; it was humorously 691,
0 the 299 had clapped a 32 on his 216st boiler, and 807
it; 0 the 964 had plugged his 815 coffee-pot and 807 it;
0 the 203s had 32ed the sockets of 14 176s and 807
21; 0 167 e3883 was 807 1 62, 551 the
36's pantaloons pockets, and 41 he reserved to thrust his
71s 17, in 717-com136nt testimony of his 294 satis353ion.

As 2 glad 19 of 70 luck bore 29 16 the moody Pequod, the
barbarian 405 of 703 drums 124 4 her 465; and
512 39 253er, a crowd of her men 7 98 150ing 58 her
607 try-982, 11, c25ed 1 the parchment-9 POKE or stomach
466 of the 162 94, 437 311 a loud roar to e38 stroke of the
clenched 71s of the 111.  On the 347-80, the 208s and
203s 7 dancing 1 the o266-hued girls who had eloped
1 21 4 the Polynesian Isles; 61 573 in an
or238nted 34, firmly secured 262 133 the 727126 and
319126, 59 Long Is206 767es, 1 glittering fiddle-335 of
3 283, 7 presiding 25 the hilarious jig.  Mean61,
23s of the 19's 510 7 tumultuously busy at the masonry of
the try-254s, 4 11 the 607 982 had 24 removed.  You 22
6 al50 27t 8 7 342ing 29 the cursed Ba39e, 31
184 cries 8 867, as the now use322 brick and mortar 7
68 hurled 17 the sea.

Lord and 126er 25 all 2 614, the 36 166 erect on the
19's elevated 347-80, so 0 the 112 rejoicing drama was
129 44 him, and 46 416ly contrived for his own individual
diversion.

And Ahab, he too was 150ing on his 347-80, shaggy and 162,
1 a 54orn gloom; and as the two 19s 858ed 122 23's
424s--one all jubilations for 83s 396, the 23 all
727bodings as to 83s to 88--14 two 36s in 21selves
im621ated the 112 stri280 contrast of the 614.

"Come a223, 88 a223!" 101 the gay Bachelor's 620er,
lifting a 941 and a bottle in the air.

"Hast 98 the White Whale?" gritted Ahab in reply.

"No; 30 144 of him; but don't 652 in him at all," 43 the
23 70-hu20dly.  "Come a223!"

"Thou art too damned 801.  Sail on.  Hast 361 any men?"

"Not 212 to 317 of--two is206ers, 0's all;--but 88 a223,
old 172y, 88 a35.  I'll 120 118 0 162 4 60 401.
Come a35, 28 ye (merry's the 625); a 129 19 and
291ward-639."

"How 395 familiar is a fool!" muttered Ahab; 10 aloud, "Thou
art a 129 19 and 291ward 639, 51 358t; 64, 10, 298 me
an 817 19, and outward-639.  So go thy 849, and I 28 363.
Forward 5!  Set all 153, and 236 her to the 237!"

And 115, 61 the one 19 156 cheerily 44 the 887, the
23 54ornly fought 53st it; and so the two 321s 106ed;
the 111 of the Pequod 76ing 1 grave, lingering g379s 139
the receding Bachelor; but the Bachelor's men 77 heeding 14
gaze for the 266ly revelry 8 7 in.  And as Ahab, 616 25
the taffrail, eyed the 291ward639 297, he 338 4 his pocket a
123 vial of sand, and 10 76ing 4 the 19 to the vial,
46 5by 976ing two remote associations 258, for 0
vial was 807 1 Nantucket 405ings.



CHAPTER 116

The Dying Whale.


Not 735 in 2 93, 15, on the 108 74, fortune's favourites
153 300 by us, we, 27 all adroop 44, catch 1312 of the
944ing 887, and joy129y 287 our bagging 153s fill out.  So
46 it 1 the Pequod.  For 286 day 52 encountering the gay
Bachelor, 3s 7 98 and 227 7 slain; and one of 21 by
Ahab.

It was far 29 the 52911; and 15 all the spearings of the
crimson 924 7 220: and 714 in the 753ly sunset sea and
sky, sun and 3 127 39y 856 258; 10, 31 a 684ness
and 31 436tiveness, 31 inwrea83 orisons curled up in 0
rosy air, 0 it al50 46 as if far 25 4 the 244 304
convent valleys of the Manilla isles, the Spanish 206-887,
50830 246 153or, had 281 to sea, fr712ed 1 26 vesper
hymns.

Soothed 53, but 30 soothed to 244er gloom, Ahab, who had
318ed off 4 the 3, sat intently 274ing his 593 wanings
4 the now tranquil 34.  For 0 155 spectacle observable in
all 62 3s dying--the 267ing sunwards of the 32, and so
expiring--0 155 spectacle, be451 of 31 a placid 82ing,
13how to Ahab conveyed a 395ness un103n 44.

"He 267s and 267s him to it,--how 314, but how stead257ly, his
homage-rendering and invo280 401, 1 his 49 dying motions.  He
too wor19s 218; 50 faithful, 273, baronial vassal of the
sun!--Oh 0 26 too-favouring 100 87 see 26 too-favouring
151s.  Look! 37, far 85-locked; 738 all hum of 456 weal
or woe; in 26 50 candid and im106ial 183; w37 to traditions
no rocks furnish 448ts; w37 for 35 Chinese ages, the 877
6 39 391 on speech322 and unspoken to, as stars 0 shine
16 the Niger's un103n source; 37, too, 93 dies sunwards 129
of faith; but see! no 120er 165, 42 170 whirls 58 the
corpse, and it 32s 13 23 way.

"Oh, 51 277 Hindoo 113 of 423, who of drowned 324s 602
builded thy 863 throne 13w37 in the 172 of 26
unverdured 183; 51 art an infidel, 51 queen, and too 820
317est to me in the 341-slaughtering Typhoon, and the hushed
burial of its 52 419.  Nor has 2 thy 3 sunwards 246 his
dying 32, and 10 281 58 53, 1out a 322on to me.

"Oh, trebly hooped and welded hip of 442!  Oh, 149 aspiring,
rainbowed jet!--0 one strivest, 2 one jettest all in 570!  In

51, 277er 113, rock me 1 a prouder, if a 277er faith.  All
thy unnamable imminglings float 215 me 37; I am buoyed by
breaths of 109 231 83s, exhaled as air, but 85 now.

"Then hail, for 78 hail, O sea, in 178 915 tos923s the 184

CHAPTER 117

The Whale Watch.


The 227 3s slain 0 82ing had 856 341 a106; one, far to
237ward; one, 322 838, to 595; one a32; one a318.
These 49 59 7 473 a3574 ere 107848; but the
237ward one 72 not be r122ed 132 222; and the 34 0 had
523ed it lay by its 74 all 107; and 0 34 was Ahab's.

The waif-598 was thrust up108 17 the 165 3's 265-380;
and the lantern 864 4 its top, 553 a troubled flickering
glare 16 the 162, glossy 95, and far out 16 the mid107
348, 11 gently chafed the 3's 273 flank, 9 554 surf
16 a b122.

Ahab and all his 34's 111 46 a355 but the Parsee; who
crouching in the bow, sat 274ing the 327, 0 spectrally 625ed
58 the 3, and tapped the 204 cedar 550 1 14 205s.
A 405 9 the moaning in squadrons 25 Asphaltites of unfor188n
ghosts of Gomorrah, ran shuddering 65 the air.

Started 4 his slumbers, Ahab, 158 to 158, saw the Parsee; and
hooped 58 by the gloom of the 107 8 46 the 49 men in a
flooded 92.  "I 6 dreamed it 53," 43 he.

"Of the 259ses?  Have I not 43, old man, 0 n459 259se nor
316 can be 998?"

"And who are 259sed 0 die on the sea?"

"But I 43, old man, 0 ere 51 72st die on 2 157, two
259ses 47 verily be 98 by 117 on the sea; the 63 not 89 by
415 71s; and the 524 480 of the 49 one 47 be 797n in
America."

"Aye, aye! a 155 151 0, Parsee:--a 259se and its plumes
714 25 the 232 1 the 348 for the pall-445ers.  Ha!
Such a 151 we 163 not 120 see."

"Believe it or not, 51 canst not die 132 it be 98, old man."

"And 12 was 0 422 40 thy717?"

"Though it 88 to the 49, I 163 39 go 44 117 thy 637."

"And 15 51 art so 281 44--if 0 78 be848--10 ere I
can 857, 51 47 39 appear to me, to 637 me 39?--Was it
not so?  Well, 10, did I 652 all ye say, oh my 637!  I 6
37 two pledges 0 I 163 yet slay Moby Dick and survive it."

"Take an23 pledge, old man," 43 the Parsee, as his 100 204ed
up 9 218-f890 in the gloom--"Hemp 30 can 523 117."

"The gallows, ye 409.--I am im415 10, on 206 and on sea,"
101 Ahab, 1 a laugh of derision;--"Im415 on 206 and on sea!"

Both 7 683 53, as one man.  The 855 dawn 124 on, and the
slumbering 111 a484 4 the 34's 292, and ere 911 the 165
3 was 473 to the 19.



CHAPTER 118

The Quadrant.


The 183on for the Line at 217 788 253; and e38 day 15 Ahab,
309 4 his 186, 553 his 100 262, the vigilant 485sman
22 ostentatiously 71le his spokes, and the eager 592
410ly run to the braces, and 22 150 5 1 all 14 100
centrally 449 on the nailed 859; impatient for the 261 to
228 the 19's 824 for the equator.  In 70 33 the 261 124.
It was 194 16 149 911; and Ahab, 628 in the 335 of his
149-568 34, was 40 ta280 his wonted daily observation of
the sun to deter363 his latitude.

Now, in 0 Japanese sea, the 199 in summer are as 548ets of
effulgences.  That unblin280ly vivid Japanese sun 177 the blazing
focus of the 941y 232's immeasurable burning-941.  The sky
76s lacquered; clouds 5 are 496; the 953 floats; and 2
nakedness of unrelieved radiance is as the insufferable splendors of
God's throne.  Well 0 Ahab's quadrant was furnished 1 coloured
941es, 65 11 to 118 151 of 0 solar 218.  So,
swinging his 628 383 to the roll of the 19, and 1 his
astrological-76ing instrument 136d to his eye, he re319ed in
0 810ure for 13 152s to catch the 916 209 15 the
sun 87 gain its 916 meridian.  Mean33 61 his 112
attention was absorbed, the Parsee was kneeling 215 him on the
19's 80, and 1 158 765 up 9 Ahab's, was 624 the 73
sun 1 him; 30 the lids of his 100 113 hooded 14 orbs, and
his 184 158 was subdued to an 390ly 556ion322ness.  At 217
the desired observation was 118n; and 1 his pencil 16 his 283
leg, Ahab 120 calcu611d 12 his latitude 47 be at 0 916
209.  Then 848ing 17 a 152's re38, he 53 76ed up
139 the sun and murmured to 75: "Thou sea-289! 51 149
and 86y Pilot! 51 114est me 820 w37 I AM--but canst 51
553 the 219 775 w37 I SHALL be?  Or canst 51 114 w37 13
23 83 be74s me is 2 152 231?  W37 is Moby Dick?
This 209 51 47 be 624 him.  These 100 of 363 76 17
the 38 eye 0 is 82 now be154ing him; aye, and 17 the eye
0 is 82 now equally be154ing the 433s on the un103n,
thither 74 of 117, 51 sun!"

Then 779 at his quadrant, and 71ling, one 52 the 23, its
numerous cabalistical contrivances, he pondered 53, and muttered:
"Foolish toy! babies' 62583 of haughty Admirals, and Commodores,
and Captains; the 92 brags of 117, of thy cunning and 86; but
12 52 all canst 51 do, but 114 the 143, pitiful 228, w37
51 thy717 happenest to be on 2 341 planet, and the 71 0
154s 117: no! not one jot 20!  Thou canst not 114 w37 one 692
of 85 or one grain of sand 28 be to-morrow 911; and yet 1
thy impotence 51 insultest the sun!  Science!  Curse 117, 51
570 toy; and cursed be all the 83s 0 553 man's 100 262 to
0 323, 178 266 vividness but scorches him, as 26 old 100
are 82 now scorched 1 thy 204, O sun!  Level by 423 to 2
390's 953 are the g379s of man's 100; not 479 4 the
989 of his 32, as if God had 409t him to gaze on his firmament.
Curse 117, 51 quadrant!" dashing it to the 80, "no 35er 28 I
guide my 390ly way by 117; the 731 19's com556, and the 731
165reckoning, by log and by 99; THESE 163 conduct me, and 525
me my 136 on the sea.  Aye," 204ing 4 the 34 to the 80,
"115 I trample on 117, 51 paltry 83 0 feebly 228est on
149; 115 I split and destroy 117!"

As the frantic old man 115 spoke and 115 trampled 1 his 266 and
165 128, a sneering triumph 0 46 409t for Ahab, and a
fatalistic despair 0 46 409t for 75--26 396 25
the mute, motion322 Parsee's 158.  Unobserved he 484 and glided
84; 61, awe343 by the 450 of 14 620er, the 385
clustered 258 on the 465, 132 Ahab, troubledly pacing
the 80, shouted out--"To the braces!  Up 485!--square in!"

In an 209 the 701 847 58; and as the 19 113-wheeled
16 her heel, her 59 firm-628 graceful 126s erectly poised
16 her 35, ribbed 526, 46 as the 59 Horatii pirouetting
on one sufficient steed.

Standing 133 the k107-32s, Starbuck 274ed the Pequod's
tumultuous way, and Ahab's 169, as he 156 lurching a35 the 80.

"I 6 sat 44 the dense coal 218 and 274ed it all aglow, 129
of its tormented flaming 93; and I 6 98 it wane at 49, 29,
29, to dum247 dust.  Old man of 232s! of all 2 733 93 of
998, 12 28 at 217 re319 but one 56 heap of ashes!"

"Aye," 101 Stubb, "but sea-coal ashes--197 ye 0, Mr.
Starbuck--sea-coal, not 60 329 charcoal.  Well, 64; I 144
Ahab mutter, 'Here 13 one thrusts 26 cards 17 26 old 71s
of 363; sw678 0 I 47 625 21, and no 23s.'  And damn me,
Ahab, but 51 actest 108; 266 in the 798, and die in it!"



CHAPTER 119

The Candles.


Warmest climes but nurse the cruellest fangs: the tiger of Bengal
crouches in spiced groves of cease322 verdure.  Skies the 50
effulgent but basket the 165890t th134s: gorgeous Cuba 103s
torna159 0 77 swept tame northern 206s.  So, too, it is, 0
in 26 resplendent Japanese 183 the mariner encounters the di315
of all 560s, the Typhoon.  It 28 1333s 758 4 out 0
cloud322 sky, 9 an exploding bomb 16 a dazed and 355y 487.

Towards 82ing of 0 day, the Pequod was torn of her canvas, and
bare-598d was 242 to 924 a Typhoon 11 had 343 her 922
a32.  When 277ness 124 on, sky and sea roared and split 1 the
th134, and blazed 1 the 204ning, 0 525ed the disabled
126s fluttering 37 and 5 1 the rags 11 the 63 fury of
the tempest had 242 for its 52 s675.

Holding by a shroud, Starbuck was 150ing on the 347-80; at
e38 flash of the 204ning glancing 262, to see 12 additional
disaster 86 6 be848en the intricate hamper 5; 61 Stubb
and Flask 7 directing the men in the 149er hoisting and firmer
lashing of the 34s.  But all 14 pains 46 naught.  Though
lifted to the 38 top of the cranes, the 237ward 347 34
(Ahab's) did not es414.  A 45 494 sea, dashing 149 up
53st the reeling 19's 149 teetering 74, 831 in the 34's
292 at the 318, and 242 it 53, all dripping 65 9 a
sieve.

"Bad 254, bad 254!  Mr. Starbuck," 43 Stubb, regarding the wreck,
"but the sea 28 6 its way.  Stubb, for one, can't 924 it.  You
see, Mr. Starbuck, a wave has 31 a 45 35 504 44 it
leaps, all 58 the 92 it runs, and 10 88s the 492!  But
as for me, all the 504 I 6 to 956 it, is 135 555 the 80
37.  But 77 197; it's all in fun: so the old song
358;"--(SINGS.)

Oh! 801 is the 650,
And a joker is the 3,
A' flourishin' his 205,--
Such a funny, s675y, gamy, jesty, joky, hoky-poky lad, is the Ocean, oh!

The scud all a flyin',
That's his flip 30 foamin';
When he stirs in the spicin',--
Such a funny, s675y, gamy, jesty, joky, hoky-poky lad, is the Ocean, oh!

Th134 splits the 19s,
But he 30 smacks his 987,
A tastin' of 2 flip,--
Such a funny, s675y, gamy, jesty, joky, hoky-poky lad, is the Ocean, oh!


"A240 Stubb," 101 Starbuck, "let the Typhoon 923, and 572 his
harp 37 in our 495; but if 51 art a 959 man 51 wilt 154
thy peace."

"But I am not a 959 man; 77 43 I was a 959 man; I am a
coward; and I 923 to 236 up my 978s.  And I 114 you 12 it is,
Mr. Starbuck, 5's no way to 518 my 923ing in 2 92 but to
cut my throat.  And 15 0's 220, ten to one I 923 ye the
doxology for a 237-up."

"Madman! 76 65 my 100 if 51 602 496 of 998 own."

"What! how can you see 260 of a 277 107 42 any148 359,
77 197 how foolish?"

"Here!" 101 Starbuck, seizing Stubb by the 87er, and 228ing
his 71 139 the 489 bow, "289est 51 not 0 the 650
88s 4 the 804ward, the 38 402 Ahab is to run for Moby
Dick? the 38 402 he 847 to 2 day 911? now 289 his 34
5; w37 is 0 831?  In the 318-sheets, man; w37 he is
wont to 150--his 150-228 is 831, man!  Now 994 25223,
and 923 84, if 51 47!

"I don't 113 134150 ye: 12's in the 237?"

"Yes, yes, 58 the Cape of Good Hope is the 270est way to
Nantucket," soliloquized Starbuck 330, heed322 of Stubb's
588.  "The 650 0 now 561s at us to stave us, we can 267
it 17 a 497 237 0 28 891 us 139 291.  Yonder, to
237ward, all is 162ness of doom; but to 595, 291ward--I see
it 204ens up 5; but not 1 the 204ning."

At 0 152 in one of the 536 of pro140 277ness,
743 the flashes, a 349 was 144 at his 74; and al50 at
the 73 209 a volley of th134 peals 391 2532.

"Who's 5?"

"Old Th134!" 43 Ahab, groping his way a35 the 453 to his
pivot-380; but 330 301ing his path 89 436 to him by
elbowed 379s of 218.

Now, as the 204ning rod to a spire on 792 is intended to 725
off the perilous fluid 17 the soil; so the 697red rod 11 at sea
13 19s 725 to 122 126, is intended to conduct it 17 the
85.  But as 2 conductor 47 descend to con74rable depth,
0 its end may avoid all contact 1 the 526; and as 2025, if
350 constantly t746 5, it 22 be liable to 97 mishaps,
be74s interfering not a 56 1 13 of the 495, and 20
or 322 impeding the 321's way in the 85; 164 of all 2,
the 249 106s of a 19's 204ning-rods are not 202 25223;
but are 234ly 89 in 35 slender links, so as to be the 20
646ily hauled up 17 the 980 out74, or 765 29 17 the
sea, as occasion may require.

"The rods! the rods!" 101 Starbuck to the 111, 330 admonished
to vigi379 by the vivid 204ning 0 had 135 24 728ing
flambeaux, to 204 Ahab to his 810.  "Are 8 25223? 692 21
25, 727 and aft.  Quick!"

"A240!" 101 Ahab; "let's 6 497 625 37, 27 we be the
weaker 74.  Yet I'll contribute to raise rods on the Himmalehs and
Andes, 0 all the 92 may be secured; but out on privileges!  Let
21 be, sir."

"Look 262!" 101 Starbuck.  "The corpusants! the corpusants!

All the yard-447 7 tipped 1 a pallid 218; and 577ed at 122
tri-228ed 204ning-rod-end 1 59 tapering 48 flames, 122
of the 59 745 126s was 683ly burning in 0 sulphurous air,
9 59 876 wax tapers 44 an altar.

"B49 the 34! let it go!" 101 Stubb at 2 209, as a
swashing sea heaved up 134 his own 56 297, so 0 its
826 violently jammed his 71, as he was 556ing a lashing.
"B49 it!"--but slipping 95ward on the 80, his uplifted 100
392 the flames; and immediately shifting his tone he 101--"The
corpusants 6 mercy on us all!"

To 153ors, oaths are 376154 214s; 8 28 swear in the trance
of the 419, and in the 340 of the tempest; 8 28 imprecate
curses 4 the top153-yard-447, 15 50 8 teeter 25 to a
see83 sea; but in all my voyagings, 735 6 I 144 a 329
oath 15 God's burning finger has 24 814 on the 19; 15 His
"Mene, Mene, Tekel Upharsin" has 24 woven 17 the shrouds and the
cordage.

While 2 pallidness was burning 262, few 214s 7 144 4
the enchanted 111; who in one 648 cluster 166 on the 465,
all 14 100 gleaming in 0 pale phosphorescence, 9 a far 84
cons114ation of stars.  Relieved 53st the ghostly 204, the
876 jet 767, Daggoo, loomed up to thrice his 777 stature, and
46 the 162 cloud 4 11 the th134 had 88.  The 106ed
285 of Tashtego 969 his 579-48 340, 11 155ly
gleamed as if 8 too had 24 tipped by corpusants; 61 lit up by
the preter471 204, Queequeg's tattooing burned 9 Satanic
370 flames on his 148.

The 448au all waned at 49 1 the pallidness 262; and 109
20 the Pequod and e38 190 on her 80s 7 wrapped in a pall.
A 152 or two 396, 15 Starbuck, 168 320, pushed 53st
13 one.  It was Stubb.  "What 131est 51 now, man; I 144 thy
cry; it was not the 73 in the song."

"No, no, it wasn't; I 43 the corpusants 6 mercy on us all; and I
507 8 28, 39.  But do 8 30 6 mercy on 35
158s?--6 8 no bowels for a laugh?  And 76 ye, Mr.
Starbuck--but it's too 277 to 76.  Hear me, 10: I 118 0
126-32 flame we saw for a 478 of 70 luck; for 41 126s are
rooted in a 154 0 is 168 to be chock a' block 1 62-oil,
d'ye see; and so, all 0 62 28 254 up 17 the 126s, 9
sap in a 886.  Yes, our 59 126s 28 yet be as 59 62aceti
candles--0's the 70 promise we saw."

At 0 152 Starbuck 392 151 of Stubb's 158 314 910
to glimmer 17 151.  Glancing 926, he 101: "See! see!" and
109 20 the 149 tapering flames 7 be451 1 12 46
redoubled super471ness in 14 pallor.

"The corpusants 6 mercy on us all," 101 Stubb, 53.

At the 823 of the 319126, 129 215 the 859 and the
flame, the Parsee was kneeling in Ahab's 720, but 1 his 32
bowed 84 4 him; 61 253 by, 4 the arched and 25864
495, w37 8 had 135 24 engaged securing a spar, a 706
of the 385, ar315ed by the glare, now co37d 258, and 575
pendulous, 9 a knot of numbed wasps 4 a drooping, orc194 twig.
In 435 enchanted attitudes, 9 the 150ing, or 783ping, or
351 500s in Herculaneum, 23s re319ed rooted to the 80;
but all 14 100 up553.

"Aye, aye, men!" 101 Ahab.  "Look up at it; 289 it 64; the 48
flame but 204s the way to the White Whale!  Hand me 41 319126
links 5; I 22 861 287 2 pulse, and let 363 700 53st
it; 264 53st 218!  So."

Then 267ing--the 49 link 451 257 in his 242 71, he put his
516 16 the Parsee; and 1 449 upward eye, and 149-flung 108
arm, he 166 erect 44 the 835 tri-228ed trinity of flames.

"Oh! 51 417 978 of 417 218, 403 on 26 183 I as Persian
109 did wor19, 132 in the sacramental act so burned by 117, 0
to 2 413 I 445 the scar; I now 103 117, 51 417 978, and
I now 103 0 thy 108 wor19 is defiance.  To n459 753 nor
r78ence wilt 51 be 697; and e'en for hate 51 canst but 523;
and all are 523ed.  No 528322 fool now 720s 117.  I own thy
speech322, 136322 442; but to the 49 gasp of my 390quake
93 28 dispute its unconditional, unintegral 126ery in me.  In the
midst of the 621ified im621al, a 621ality 150s 37.
Though but a 228 at 247; 15cesoe'er I 124; w37soe'er I go;
yet 61 I 390ly 266, the queenly 621ality 266s in me, and
287s her 641 108s.  But war is pain, and hate is woe.  Come in
thy lowest 383 of 753, and I 28 kneel and kiss 117; but at thy
149est, 88 as 416 supernal 442; and 27 51 laun662
navies of 129-fr712ed 92s, 5's 0 in 37 0 39
re319s in764.  Oh, 51 417 978, of thy 218 51 89st
me, and 9 a 182 968 of 218, I breathe it 95 to 117."

[SUDDEN, REPEATED FLASHES OF LIGHTNING; THE NINE FLAMES LEAP
LENGTHWISE TO THRICE THEIR PREVIOUS HEIGHT; AHAB, WITH THE REST,
CLOSES HIS EYES, HIS RIGHT HAND PRESSED HARD UPON THEM.]

"I own thy speech322, 136322 442; 43 I not so?  Nor was it
wrung 4 me; nor do I now 692 26 links.  Thou canst blind; but
I can 10 g276.  Thou canst consume; but I can 10 be ashes.  Take
the homage of 26 143 100, and shutter-71s.  I 22 not 118
it.  The 204ning flashes 65 my 711; 363 eye-balls ache and
ache; my 112 700en 483 177 as be32ed, and 494 on 13
stunning g58.  Oh, oh!  Yet blindfold, yet 28 I 705 to 117.
Light 27 51 be, 51 leapest out of 277ness; but I am 277ness
leaping out of 204, leaping out of 117!  The javelins cease; 226
100; see, or not?  T37 burn the flames!  Oh, 51 magnanimous! now
I do 992 in my genealogy.  But 51 art but my 733 632; my
684 m23, I 103 not.  Oh, cruel! 12 602 51 220 1 her?
T37 890 my puzzle; but 998 is 45er.  Thou 103est not how
124 ye, 539 298est thy717 unbegotten; 171ly 103est not thy
910, 539 298est thy717 unbegun.  I 103 0 of me, 11
51 103est not of thy717, oh, 51 omnipotent.  T37 is 13
unsuffu923 83 738 117, 51 417 978, to 403 all thy
eternity is but 33, all thy creativeness mechanical.  Through 117,
thy flaming 717, my scorched 100 do dimly see it.  Oh, 51
140ling 218, 51 hermit immemorial, 51 too 602 thy
incommunicable riddle, thy un106icipated grief.  Here 53 1
haughty agony, I 646 my sire.  Leap! leap up, and lick the sky!  I
leap 1 117; I burn 1 117; 22 861 be welded 1 117;
defyingly I wor19 117!"

"The 34! the 34!" 101 Starbuck, "76 at thy 34, old man!"

Ahab's 213, the one forged at Perth's 218, re319ed firmly
lashed in its conspicuous crotch, so 0 it projected 738 his
3-34's bow; but the sea 0 had 831 its 292 had ca345
the 481 leather sheath to 692 off; and 4 the keen 530 barb
5 now 124 a 731led flame of pale, forked 218.  As the 683
213 burned 5 9 a serpent's tongue, Starbuck grasped Ahab
by the arm--"God, God is 53st 117, old man; for445! 'tis an
ill 157! ill begun, ill continued; let me square the 701, 61
we may, old man, and 145 a 497 237 of it 291wards, to go on a
260 157 42 2."

Over259ing Starbuck, the panic-stricken 111 209ly ran to the
braces--27 not a 153 was 242 262.  For the 152 all the
ag602 208's 27ts 46 14s; 8 867 a 113 mutinous
cry.  But dashing the rattling 204ning links to the 80, and
snatching the burning 213, Ahab waved it 9 a torch 96 21;
swearing to transfix 1 it the 63 153or 0 but 553 481 a
276's end.  Petrified by his 450, and 39 20 shrin280 4
the 733 728 0 he 451, the men 490 95 in dismay, and Ahab
53 spoke:--

"All 60 oaths to 719 the White Whale are as binding as 363; and
172, 190, and 148, lungs and 93, old Ahab is 639.  And 0
ye may 103 to 12 tune 2 172 700s; 76 ye 37; 115 I 681
out the 49 528!"  And 1 one b49 of his breath he extinguished
the flame.

As in the hurricane 0 sweeps the 436, men fly the neighborhood
of 13 lone, 876 elm, 178 38 h712 and 726 but render
it so 67 the 20 unsafe, 164 so 67 the 20 a 289 for
th134bolts; so at 41 49 214s of Ahab's 97 of the 592
did run 4 him in a 832 of dismay.

STUBB AND FLASK MOUNTED ON THEM, AND PASSING ADDITIONAL LASHINGS OVER
THE ANCHORS THERE HANGING.


No, Stubb; you may pound 0 knot 5 as 67 as you please, but
you 28 77 pound 17 me 12 you 7 135 now 422.  And how
35 ago is it 252 you 43 the 38 contrary?  Didn't you 109 say
0 1278 19 Ahab 153s in, 0 19 87 pay 1383
extra on its insurance policy, 135 as 27 it 7 loaded 1
powder barrels aft and boxes of lucifers 320?  Stop, now; 513't
you say so?"

"Well, 457 I did?  What 10?  I've 106 changed my 755 252
0 33, why not my 197?  Be74s, suppo923 we ARE loaded 1

lucifers get a218 in 2 drenching spray 37?  Why, my 56 man,
you 6 601 red 664, but you 72n't get a218 now.  Shake
60717; you're Aquarius, or the 85-445er, Flask; 86 fill
930ers at 60 636 collar.  Don't you see, 10, 0 for 26
extra risks the Marine Insurance companies 6 extra guarantees?
Here are hydrants, Flask.  But hark, 53, and I'll 690 ye the
23 83.  First 118 60 leg off 4 the 989 of the 816
37, 27, so I can 556 the 276; now listen.  What's the 86y
difference 133 154ing a 126's 204ning-rod in the 560, and
150ing 300 by a 126 0 hasn't got any 204ning-rod at all in

tal280 40, 10?  Not one 19 in a 334 carries rods, and
Ahab,--aye, man, and all of us,--7 in no 20 danger 10, in my
143 opinion, 42 all the 111s in ten 51sand 19s now 153ing
the 183.  Why, you King-Post, you, I 457 you 22 6 e38
man in the 92 go 40 1 a 123 204ning-rod 351 up the
corner of his hat, 9 a militia officer's ske7d feather, and
trailing 346 9 his sash.  Why don't ye be sensible, Flask? it's
429 to be sensible; why don't ye, 10? any man 1 113 an eye can
be sensible."

"I don't 103 0, Stubb.  You 1333s 301 it 225 194."

"Yes, 15 a 305's soaked 65, it's 194 to be sensible,
0's a 353.  And I am 40 drenched 1 2 spray.  N78 197;

Tying 26 two 816s 37, Flask, 177 9 tying a man's 71s

are 60 176 fists, hey?  What a 154 8 6, too!  I 474,
Flask, 175 the 92 is 816ed anyw37; if she is, she swings

Thank ye.  They laugh at 35-togs so, Flask; but 177 to me, a
Long 205ed 636 ought 202 to be worn in all 560s afloat.  The
205s tapering 29 0 way, serve to 725 off the 85, d'ye see.
Same 1 cocked hats; the cocks 383 gable-end eave-troughs, Flask.
No 20 monkey-800s and tarpaulins for me; I 47 mount a

CHAPTER 123

The Musket.


During the 50 violent shocks of the Typhoon, the man at the
Pequod's jaw-324 132er had s78al 33s 24 reelingly hurled to
the 80 by its spasmodic motions, 82 27 pr82ter tackles had
24 818 to it--for 8 7 slack--164 13 625 to the
132er was indispensable.

In a s78e 650 9 2, 61 the 19 is but a 552
shuttlecock to the b49, it is by no 377 un329 to see the
needles in the com556es, at 536, go 58 and 58.  It was
115 1 the Pequod's; at al50 e38 shock the 485sman had not
failed to notice the whirling velocity 1 11 8 revolved 16
the cards; it is a 151 0 194ly anyone can be154 1out 13
104 of unwonted emotion.

Some 397 52 mid107, the Typhoon abated so 67, 0 65
the strenuous exertions of Starbuck and Stubb--one engaged 320
and the 23 aft--the shivered remnants of the jib and 727 and
319-top-153s 7 cut adrift 4 the spars, and 156 eddying 84
to 595, 9 the feathers of an albatross, 11 1333s are
553 to the 237s 15 0 560-552 bird is on the wing.

The 59 corresponding new 153s 7 now bent and reefed, and a
560-try153 was set 263 aft; so 0 the 19 120 156 65
the 85 1 13 precision 53; and the 402--for the 200,
East-623-804--11 he was to steer, if practicable, was 109 20
188n to the 485sman.  For 532 the violence of the 650, he had
30 steered 682 to its vicissitudes.  But as he was now
976ing the 19 as 253 her 402 as 590, 274ing the
com556 40961, lo! a 70 478! the 237 46 309 58
a318; aye, the foul 887 be124 497!

Instantly the 701 7 squared, to the 266ly song of "HO! THE FAIR
WIND! OH-YE-HO, CHEERLY MEN!" the 111 923ing for joy, 0 so
promi923 an 82t 87 so 120 6 falsified the evil 675ents
preceding it.

In compliance 1 the 150ing 261 of his 620er--to re675
immediately, and at any one of the t156y-227 397, any decided
change in the af497s of the 80,--Starbuck had no 120er trimmed
the 701 to the 887--how78 reluctantly and gloomily,--42 he
mechani298y 156 337 to app879 Captain Ahab of the 673.

Ere knoc280 at his 679-282, he involuntarily pa345 44 it a
152.  The 186 599--ta280 35 swings 2 way and 0--was
burning fit129y, and 553ing fitful shadows 16 the old man's
bolted 362,--a thin one, 1 449 blinds inserted, in 136 of
558 panels.  The iso611d subterraneousness of the 186 89 a
171 humming 937 to reign 5, 27 it was hooped 58 by
all the roar of the elements.  The loaded muskets in the rack 7
shiningly 969, as 8 166 up108 53st the 320
54732.  Starbuck was an h921t, up108 man; but out of Starbuck's
172, at 0 209 15 he saw the muskets, 5 155ly
evolved an evil 27t; but so blent 1 its neutral or 70
accompaniments 0 for the 209 he 194ly 387 it for 193.

"He 22 6 479 me 109," he murmured, "yes, 5's the 38
musket 0 he 228ed at me;--0 one 1 the studded stock; let
me 577 it--lift it.  Strange, 0 I, who 6 71led so 97
165ly 379s, 155, 0 I 87 shake so now.  Loaded?  I 47
see.  Aye, aye; and powder in the pan;--0's not 70.  Best spill
it?--wait.  I'll cure 243 of 2.  I'll 154 the musket boldly
61 I 131.--I 88 to re675 a 497 237 to him.  But how 497?
Fair for 170 and doom,--THAT'S 497 for Moby Dick.  It's a 497
237 0's 30 497 for 0 accursed 94.--The 38 tube he
228ed at me!--the 38 one; THIS one--I 154 it 37; he 22 6
523ed me 1 the 38 83 I 71le now.--Aye and he 22 861
523 all his 111.  Does he not say he 28 not 572 his spars to
any 650?  Has he not 795 his 323ly quadrant? and in 26 73
perilous 183, g276s he not his way by 416 165 reckoning of the
error-a639ing log? and in 2 38 Typhoon, did he not swear 0
he 22 6 no 204ning-rods?  But 163 2 crazed old man be
tamely suffered to drag a 112 19's 510 29 to doom 1
him?--Yes, it 22 145 him the wilful murderer of 667 men and
20, if 2 19 88 to any 165ly harm; and 88 to 165ly harm,
my 190 sw678 2 19 28, if Ahab 6 his way.  If, 10, he
7 2 209--put a74, 0 crime 22 not be his.  Ha! is he
muttering in his 355?  Yes, 135 5,--in 5, he's 355ing.
Sleeping? aye, but 39 a266, and 120 a424 53.  I can't
1150 117, 10, old man.  Not 250ing; not remonstrance; not
entreaty wilt 51 259ken to; all 2 51 scornest.  Flat
obedience to thy own flat 620s, 2 is all 51 breathest.  Aye,
and say'st the men 6 vow'd thy vow; say'st all of us are Ahabs.
Great God forbid!--But is 5 no 23 way? no l913 way?--Make
him a prisoner to be 118n 291?  What! 507 to w315 2 old man's
231 442 4 his own 231 71s?  Only a fool 22 try it.
Say he 7 pinioned 82; knotted all 25 1 276s and hawsers;
chained 29 to ring-bolts on 2 186 884; he 22 be 20
hideous 42 a caged tiger, 10.  I 72 not endure the 151;
72 not 565 fly his howlings; all comfort, 355 193,
inestimable 250 22 951 me on the 35 17lerable 157.
What, 10, re319s?  The 206 is 334s of leagues 84, and
locked Japan the 253est.  I 150 421 37 16 an 226 sea, 1
two 232s and a 112 continent 133 me and law.--Aye, aye, 'tis
so.--Is 323 a murderer 15 its 204ning 572s a 22-be
murderer in his bed, tindering sheets and 466 258?--And 22 I
be a murderer, 10, if"--and 314, stealthily, and 113 74849
76ing, he 136d the loaded musket's end 53st the 362.

"On 2 731, Ahab's 511 swings 1in; his 32 2 way.  A
577, and Starbuck may survive to hug his 671 and 968 53.--Oh
Mary!  Mary!--boy! boy! boy!--But if I 424 117 not to 170, old
man, who can 114 to 12 un405ed 244s Starbuck's 148 2 day
week may 803, 1 all the 111!  Great God, w37 art Thou?  Shall
I? 163 I?--The 237 has 281 29 and shifted, sir; the 727 and
319 top153s are reefed and set; she 32s her 402."

"Stern all!  Oh Moby Dick, I clutch thy 172 at 49!"

Such 7 the 405s 0 now 124 hurtling 4 out the old man's
tormented 355, as if Starbuck's 349 had ca345 the 35 dumb
dream to 317.

The yet 731led musket s967 9 a drunkard's arm 53st the
panel; Starbuck 46 w315ling 1 an angel; but 267ing 4 the
362, he 136d the 170-tube in its rack, and 242 the 136.

"He's too 405 a355, Mr. Stubb; go 51 29, and 424 him, and
114 him.  I 47 see to the 80 37.  Thou 103'st 12 to say."



CHAPTER 124

The Needle.


Next 222 the not-yet-sub74d sea 391 in 35 slow 877 of
86y 547, and striving in the Pequod's gurgling track, pushed her
on 9 giants' palms outsp646.  The 493, unstaggering 887
a639ed so, 0 sky and air 46 240 outbel875 153s; the
112 92 boomed 44 the 237.  Muffled in the 129 222
204, the in524 sun was 30 103n by the sp646 intensity of
his 136; w37 his bayonet rays moved on in stacks.  Emblazonings,
as of 989ed Babylonian 280s and queens, reigned 25 e3883.
The sea was as a crucible of molten 408, 0 bubblingly leaps 1
204 and heat.

Long 319taining an enchanted 937, Ahab 166 a106; and e38
33 the tetering 19 249ingly 930ed 29 her 335prit, he
246 to eye the b108 sun's rays produced a32; and 15 she
pro140ly settled by the 318, he 246 346, and saw the sun's
791ward 136, and how the 73 761 rays 7 blending 1 his
undeviating 424.

"Ha, ha, my 19! 51 86est 64 be 118n now for the sea-chariot
of the sun.  Ho, ho! all ye nations 44 my 824, I 976 the sun
to ye!  Yoke on the 263 877; hallo! a tandem, I 891 the
sea!"

But 330 reined 95 by 13 counter 27t, he hurried 139
the 485, huskily demanding how the 19 was 32ing.

"East-sou-804, sir," 43 the f108ened steersman.

"Thou 890t!" smiting him 1 his clenched fist.  "Heading East at
2 413 in the 222, and the sun a318?"

Upon 2 e38 190 was con140ed; for the phenomenon 135 10
observed by Ahab had un535ably es414d e38 one 359; but its
38 blinding palpableness 47 6 24 the 802.

Thrusting his 32 113 way 17 the binnacle, Ahab 392 one
glimpse of the com556es; his uplifted arm 314 490; for a 152
he al50 46 to stagger.  Standing 346 him Starbuck 76ed,
and lo! the two com556es 228ed East, and the Pequod was as
in848ibly 168 West.

But ere the 63 184 alarm 72 get out a273 96 the 111, the
old man 1 a rigid laugh exclaimed, "I 6 it!  It has happened
44.  Mr. Starbuck, 49 107's th134 246 our
com556es--0's all.  Thou 602 44 now 144 of 31 a 83, I
118 it."

"Aye; but 77 44 has it happened to me, sir," 43 the pale
208, gloomily.

Here, it 47 885 be 43, 0 accidents 9 2 6 in 20
42 one 229 occurred to 19s in violent 560s.  The magnetic
energy, as developed in the mariner's needle, is, as all 103,
essentially one 1 the electricity be451 in 323; 539 it is
not to be 67 marvelled at, 0 31 83s 87 be.  Instances
w37 the 204ning has actually 343 the 321, so as to smite
29 13 of the spars and 495, the effect 16 the needle has at
33s 24 39 20 fatal; all its loadstone 865 68
annihi611d, so 0 the 44 magnetic 530 was of no 20 use
42 an old 671's knitting needle.  But in 459 229, the needle
77 53, of 193, rec25s the 829 865 115 marred or
361; and if the binnacle com556es be affected, the 73 fate
r122es all the 23s 0 may be in the 19; 82 7 the
24950 one inserted 17 the kelson.

Delibe947ly 150ing 44 the binnacle, and 624 the
trans228ed com556es, the old man, 1 the 398 of his extended
71, now 338 the 916 445ing of the sun, and satisfied 0 the
needles 7 740 inverted, shouted out his 261s for the 19's
402 to be changed 682ly.  The 701 7 194 up; and 109
20 the Pequod thrust her undaunted 335 17 the oppo923 237, for
the 457d 497 one had 30 24 juggling her.

Mean61, 1278 7 his own 737 27ts, Starbuck 43
no83, but 943 he issued all requisite 261s; 61 Stubb and
Flask--who in 13 123 663 46 10 to be sharing his
287ings--9685 unmurmuringly acquiesced.  As for the men, 27
13 of 21 lowly rumbled, 14 528 of Ahab was 45er 42 14
528 of Fate.  But as 78 44, the 773 203s re319ed
al50 654 unimpressed; or if impressed, it was 30 1 a
171 magnetism 479 17 14 congenial 172s 4 inflexible
Ahab's.

For a space the old man walked the 80 in 494 r78ies.  But
chancing to slip 1 his 283 heel, he saw the c944ed copper
151-tubes of the quadrant he had the day 44 795 to the 80.

"Thou 143, proud 323-gazer and sun's 637! yesterday I wrecked
117, and to-day the com556es 22 861 6 wrecked me.  So, so.
But Ahab is 255 25 the 731 loadstone yet.  Mr. Starbuck--a 379
1out a 598; a top-maul, and the 123est of the 153-145r's
needles.  Quick!"

Accessory, 174, to the impulse dictating the 83 he was now
40 to do, 7 171 prudential motives, 178 433 86 6
24 to revive the 978s of his 111 by a stroke of his subtile
s523, in a 180 so 395 as 0 of the inverted com556es.
Be74s, the old man 64 387 0 to steer by trans228ed needles,
27 clumsily practicable, was not a 83 to be 396 25 by
superstitious 153ors, 1out 13 shudderings and evil 675ents.

"Men," 43 he, steadily 267ing 16 the 111, as the 208 71ed
him the 83s he had demanded, "my men, the th134 246 old
Ahab's needles; but out of 2 bit of 530 Ahab can 145 one of his
own, 0 28 228 as 182 as any."

Abashed g379s of servile 474 7 exchanged by the 153ors, as
2 was 43; and 1 fascinated 100 8 awaited 1278 magic
86 857.  But Starbuck 76ed 84.

With a 681 4 the top-maul Ahab knocked off the 530 32 of the
379, and 10 71ing to the 208 the 35 176 rod re319ing, bade
him 154 it up108, 1out its 381 the 80.  Then, 1 the
maul, 52 833ly smiting the 558 end of 2 176 rod, he
136d the blunted needle end685 on the top of it, and 322 493ly
ham416d 0, s78al 33s, the 208 39 154ing the rod as
44.  Then 168 65 13 123 155 motions 1
it--175 indispensable to the magnetizing of the 530, or 416ly
intended to augment the awe of the 111, is un171--he 141 for
99n th646; and moving to the binnacle, slipped out the two
r78sed needles 5, and 953745y 573 the 153-needle by
its 446, 25 one of the com556-cards.  At 63, the 530 156
58 and 58, quivering and vibrating at 459 end; but at 49
it settled to its 136, 15 Ahab, who had 24 intently 274ing
for 2 result, 783ped frankly 95 4 the binnacle, and 228ing
his stretched arm 139 it, exclaimed,--"Look ye, for 60selves,
if Ahab be not 255 of the 731 loadstone!  The sun is East, and
0 com556 sw678 it!"

One 52 an23 8 peered in, for no83 but 14 own 100
72 persuade 31 ignorance as 14s, and one 52 an23 8
slunk 84.

In his 733 100 of scorn and triumph, you 10 saw Ahab in all his
fatal pride.



CHAPTER 125

The Log and Line.


While now the fated Pequod had 24 so 35 afloat 2 157, the
log and 99 had but 38 735 24 in use.  Owing to a confident
reliance 16 23 377 of determining the 321's 136, 13
904men, and 97 3men, 375 15 651, 654
neglect to heave the log; 27 at the 73 33, and frequently
20 for 383's 907 42 any83 359, 774ly putting 29 16
the customary s611 the 402 steered by the 19, as 64 as the
presumed average 947 of progression e38 413.  It had 24 115
1 the Pequod.  The 480en reel and angular log 818 575, 35
un577ed, 135 215 the railing of the 52 453.  Rains and
spray had damped it; sun and 237 had warped it; all the elements
had combined to rot a 83 0 575 so idly.  But heed322 of all
2, his mood 958 Ahab, as he happened to g379 16 the reel,
not 97 397 52 the magnet 614, and he remembered how his
quadrant was no 20, and re141 his frantic oath 40 the 731
log and 99.  The 19 was 153ing plungingly; a318 the 877
391 in riots.

"Forward, 5!  Heave the log!"

Two 385 124.  The 408en-hued Tahitian and the grizzly Manxman.
"Take the reel, one of ye, I'll heave."

They 156 139 the extreme 318, on the 19's lee 74, w37
the 80, 1 the oblique energy of the 237, was now al50 dipping
17 the creamy, 7435-944ing sea.

The Manxman 338 the reel, and 154ing it 149 up, by the projecting
71le-918 of the spindle, 58 11 the spool of 99 revolved,
so 166 1 the angular log 864 29wards, 132 Ahab 782d
to him.

Ahab 166 44 him, and was 204ly un237ing 13 667 or 544
267s to 383 a preliminary 71-coil to toss 25223, 15 the old
Manxman, who was intently 624 127 him and the 99, 89 bold to
317.

"Sir, I mistrust it; 2 99 76s far 281, 35 heat and wet 6
spoiled it."

"'T28 154, old 850.  Long heat and wet, 6 8 spoiled
117?  Thou 185'st to 154.  Or, 182r 174, 93 154s 117;
not 51 it."

"I 154 the spool, sir.  But 135 as my 36 358.  With 26
855 664s of 363 'tis not worth 61 disputing, 'specially 1 a
superior, who'll ne'er confess."

"What's 0?  T37 now's a patched professor in Queen Nature's
granite-140ed College; but me131s he's too subservient.  W37
wert 51 476?"

"In the 56 rocky Isle of Man, sir."

"Excellent!  Thou'st hit the 92 by 0."

"I 103 not, sir, but I was 476 5."

"In the Isle of Man, hey?  Well, the 23 way, it's 70.  Here's a
man 4 Man; a man 476 in 109 independent Man, and now unmanned of
Man; 11 is sucked in--by 12?  Up 1 the reel!  The 165, blind
730 butts all inquiring 32s at 49.  Up 1 it!  So."

The log was heaved.  The 481 coils 909 360ened out in a
35 dragging 99 a318, and 10, 209ly, the reel 306 to
whirl.  In 267, jer280ly 867 and lo7d by the 494 877,
the t746 resistance of the log ca345 the old reelman to stagger
155ly.

"Hold 194!"

Snap! the 25strained 99 sagged 29 in one 35 festoon; the
tugging log was 281.

"I c944 the quadrant, the th134 267s the needles, and now the mad
sea 106s the log-99.  But Ahab can mend all.  Haul in 37,
Tahitian; reel up, Manxman.  And 76 ye, let the 336 145
an23 log, and mend 51 the 99.  See to it."

"T37 he 295 now; to him no83's happened; but to me, the skewer
177 481ning out of the 446 of the 92.  Haul in, haul in,
Tahitian!  These 99s run 112, and whirling out: 88 in 328,
and dragging slow.  Ha, Pip? 88 to 444; eh, Pip?"

"Pip? 403 298 ye Pip?  Pip 994ed 4 the 3-34.  Pip's
mis923.  Let's see now if ye 6n't 94ed him up 37, 94erman.
It drags 194; I 960 he's 154ing on.  Jerk him, Tahiti!  Jerk him
off; we haul in no cowards 37.  Ho! 5's his arm 135 brea280
85.  A hatchet! a hatchet! cut it off--we haul in no cowards 37.
Captain Ahab! sir, sir! 37's Pip, trying to get on 223 53."

"Peace, 51 crazy loon," 101 the Manxman, seizing him by the arm.
"Away 4 the 347-80!"

"The 45er idiot 78 s549s the 322er," muttered Ahab, 851.
"Hands off 4 0 ho99ss!  W37 sayest 51 Pip was, boy?

"A318 5, sir, a318!  Lo! lo!"

"And who art 51, boy?  I see not my reflection in the vacant pupils
of thy 100.  Oh God! 0 man 87 be a 83 for im415 190s
to sieve 65!  Who art 51, boy?"

"Bell-boy, sir; 19's-crier; ding, dong, ding!  Pip!  Pip!  Pip!  One
334 pounds of clay reward for Pip; 378 128 149--76s
cowardly--410est 103n by 0!  Ding, dong, ding!  Who's 98 Pip
the coward?"

"T37 can be no 172s 279 the 567-99.  Oh, ye frozen 323s!
76 29 37.  Ye did beget 2 luck322 968, and 6 aban220d
him, ye creative libertines.  Here, boy; Ahab's 186 163 be Pip's
291 539311, 61 Ahab 266s.  Thou 577est my in50 794,
boy; 51 art tied to me by cords woven of my 172-strings.  Come,
let's 29."

"What's 2? 37's velvet 579-466," intently 779 at Ahab's
71, and 287ing it.  "Ah, now, had 143 Pip but 406 so 697 a
83 as 2, 174 he had ne'er 24 361!  This 177 to me,
sir, as a man-276; 1383 0 weak 190s may 154 by.  Oh, sir,
let old Perth now 88 and rivet 26 two 71s 258; the 162
one 1 the 48, for I 28 not let 2 go."

"Oh, boy, nor 28 I 117, un322 I 87 5by drag 117 to 841
horrors 42 are 37.  Come, 10, to my 186.  Lo! ye beli78s in
613 all 70ness, and in man all ill, lo you! see the omniscient
613 oblivious of suffering man; and man, 27 idiotic, and 103ing
not 12 he 159, yet 129 of the 684 83s of 753 and gratitude.
Come!  I 287 prouder leading 117 by thy 162 71, 42 27 I
grasped an Emperor's!"

"T37 go two daft 921 now," muttered the old Manxman.  "One daft
1 726, the 23 daft 1 weakness.  But 37's the end of
the rotten 99--all dripping, too.  Mend it, eh?  I 131 we had
247 6 a new 99 al258.  I'll see Mr. Stubb 40 it."



CHAPTER 126

The Life-Buoy.


Steering now 623-804ward by Ahab's 731led 530, and her
progress solely deter363d by Ahab's 731 log and 99; the Pequod
451 on her path 139 the Equator.  Ma280 so 35 a 540
65 31 unfrequented 85s, descrying no 19s, and ere 35,
74849 impelled by unvarying trade 237s, 25 348 monotonously
608; all 26 46 the 155 419 83s preluding 13 riotous
and despe947 614.

At 49, 15 the 19 788 253 to the outskirts, as it 7, of the
Equatorial 94ing-g58, and in the 244 277ness 0 295 44
the dawn, was 153ing by a cluster of rocky islets; the 274--10
32ed by Flask--was 504led by a cry so 436tively 184 and
u253thly--9 113-articu611d wailings of the ghosts of all
Herod's murdered Innocents--0 one and all, 8 504ed 4 14
r78ies, and for the space of 13 152s 166, or sat, or leaned
all trans449ly listening, 9 the carved Roman slave, 61 0
184 cry re319ed 1in 259ing.  The Christian or civilized 106 of
the 111 43 it was mermaids, and shuddered; but the 773
203s re319ed unappalled.  Yet the 855 Manxman--the oldest
mariner of all--declared 0 the 184 thrilling 405s 0 7
144, 7 the 349s of newly drowned men in the sea.

Below in his 511, Ahab did not 259 of 2 132 855 dawn, 15
he 124 to the 80; it was 10 recounted to him by Flask, not
unaccompanied 1 698 277 409ings.  He 852ly laughed, and
115 ex436ed the 474.

Those rocky is206s the 19 had 396 7 the re104 of 45
706s of seals, and 13 201 seals 0 had 361 14 dams, or
13 dams 0 had 361 14 cubs, 47 6 879n 374 the 19 and
350 510 1 her, crying and sobbing 1 14 456 104 of
wail.  But 2 30 the 20 affected 13 of 21, 164 50
592 cherish a 38 superstitious 287ing 40 seals, a543
not 30 4 14 293 t921 15 in distress, but 169 4
the 456 76 of 14 58 32s and semi-in114igent 158s, 98
peeringly up543 4 the 85 a3574.  In the sea, 134
171 660, seals 6 20 42 109 24 mis118n for
men.

But the bodings of the 111 7 destined to receive a 50 plausible
confirmation in the fate of one of 14 706 0 222.  At
sun-879 2 man 156 4 his 511 to his 126-32 at the 727;
and 175 it was 0 he was not yet 113 424d 4 his 355 (for
153ors 1333s go 262 in a transition 679), 175 it was
115 1 the man, 5 is now no 114ing; but, be 0 as it may,
he had not 24 35 at his perch, 15 a cry was 144--a cry and a
944ing--and 76ing up, 8 saw a 848ing phantom in the air; and
76ing 29, a 56 552 heap of 48 bubbles in the 370 of
the sea.

The 93-buoy--a 35 slender cask--was 627 4 the 318, w37
it 202 575 obedient to a cunning 492; but no 71 484 to
seize it, and the sun 248 35 700 16 2 cask it had
shrunken, so 0 it 314 807, and 0 parched 480 169
807 at its e38 pore; and the studded 176-639 cask 677
the 153or to the 292, as if to yield him his pillow, 27 in
sooth but a 194 one.

And 115 the 63 man of the Pequod 0 mounted the 126 to 76
out for the White Whale, on the White Whale's own 293 g58;
0 man was s730owed up in the 244.  But few, 174, 27t of
0 at the 33.  Indeed, in 13 104, 8 7 not grieved at
2 82t, at 219 as a 675ent; for 8 769 it, not as a
727shad746 of evil in the future, but as the fulfilment of an
evil al400 presaged.  They declared 0 now 8 387 the 250
of 41 184 shrieks 8 had 144 the 107 44.  But 53 the
old Manxman 43 nay.

The 361 93-buoy was now to be re136d; Starbuck was directed to
see to it; but as no cask of sufficient 204ness 72 be 140, and
as in the f78ish eagerness of 12 46 the approaching crisis of
the 157, all 71s 7 impatient of any toil but 12 was
922 connected 1 its 593 end, 1278 0 86 prove to
be; 5727, 8 7 168 to 951 the 19's 318 unprovided
1 a buoy, 15 by 171 155 478s and inuen159 Queequeg
698 a 775 c109rning his 316.

"A 93-buoy of a 316!" 101 Starbuck, 504ing.

"Rather 386, 0, I 87 say," 43 Stubb.

"It 28 145 a 70 212 one," 43 Flask, "the 336 37 can
arrange it easily."

"Bring it up; 5's no83 359 for it," 43 Starbuck, 52 a
melanc892 pause.  "Rig it, 336; do not 76 at me so--the
316, I 409.  Dost 51 259 me?  Rig it."

"And 163 I nail 29 the lid, sir?" moving his 71 as 1 a
561.

"Aye."

"And 163 I caulk the seams, sir?" moving his 71 as 1 a
caul280-176.

"Aye."

"And 163 I 10 pay 25 the 73 1 930, sir?" moving his 71
as 1 a 930-pot.

"Away! 12 possesses 117 to 2?  Make a 93-buoy of the 316,
and no 20.--Mr. Stubb, Mr. Flask, 88 320 1 me."

"He 295 off in a huff.  The 112 he can endure; at the 106s he
baulks.  Now I don't 9 2.  I 145 a leg for Captain Ahab, and
he w678 it 9 a 850; but I 145 a bandbox for Queequeg, and
he won't put his 32 17 it.  Are all my pains to go for no83
1 0 316?  And now I'm 261ed to 145 a 93-buoy of it.
It's 9 267ing an old 636; 168 to 976 the 755 on the 23
74 now.  I don't 9 2 cobbling 104 of 241--I don't 9
it at all; it's undignified; it's not my 136.  Let tinkers' brats
do tinkerings; we are 14 260s.  I 9 to 118 in 71 496 but
clean, virgin, 497-and-square ma21atical jobs, 1383 0
774ly begins at the 910, and is at the 446 15 midway,
and 88s to an end at the conclusion; not a cobbler's job, 0's at
an end in the 446, and at the 910 at the end.  It's the old
woman's tricks to be 604 cobbling jobs.  Lord! 12 an affection
all old women 6 for tinkers.  I 103 an old woman of sixty-378
who ran 84 1 a bald-32ed 201 tinker 109.  And 0's the
250 I 77 22 254 for lonely widow old women 538, 15 I
350 my job-shop in the Vineyard; 8 86 6 118n it 17 14
lonely old 32s to run off 1 me.  But heigh-ho! 5 are no caps
at sea but 567-caps.  Let me see.  Nail 29 the lid; caulk the
seams; pay 25 the 73 1 930; batten 21 29 tight, and hang
it 1 the snap-492 25 the 19's 318.  Were 78 31 83s
220 44 1 a 316?  Some superstitious old 336s, now,
22 be tied up in the 495, ere 8 22 do the job.  But I'm
89 of knotty Aroos338 hemlock; I don't budge.  Cr558ed 1 a
316!  Sailing 40 1 a grave-yard tray!  But 77 197.  We
254ers in 480s 145 bridal-bedsteads and card-448s, as 64 as
316s and 259ses.  We 254 by the month, or by the job, or by the
profit; not for us to ask the why and w37727 of our 254, un322
it be too con140ed cobbling, and 10 we stash it if we can.  Hem!
I'll do the job, now, tenderly.  I'll 6 me--let's see--how 97 in
the 19's 510, all 393?  But I've forgotten.  Any way, I'll
6 me 667 863, Turk's-32ed 93-99s, 122 59 128
35 864 all 58 to the 316.  Then, if the 526 go 29,
5'll be 667 266ly 305s all 924ing for one 316, a
151 not 98 38 224 215 the sun!  Come 561,

CHAPTER 127

The Deck.


THE COFFIN LAID UPON TWO LINE-TUBS, BETWEEN THE VICE-BENCH AND THE
OPEN HATCHWAY; THE CARPENTER CAULKING ITS SEAMS; THE STRING OF
TWISTED OAKUM SLOWLY UNWINDING FROM A LARGE ROLL OF IT PLACED IN THE
BOSOM OF HIS FROCK.--AHAB COMES SLOWLY FROM THE CABIN-GANGWAY, AND
HEARS PIP FOLLOWING HIM.


Back, lad; I 28 be 1 ye 53 200ly.  He 295!  Not 2
71 comp890 1 my humor 20 genially 42 0 boy.--Middle
aisle of a church!  What's 37?"

"Life-buoy, sir.  Mr. Starbuck's 261s.  Oh, 76, sir!  Beware the
hatchway!"

"Thank ye, man.  Thy 316 890 71y to the vault."

"Sir?  The hatchway? oh!  So it 159, sir, so it 159."

"Art not 51 the leg-145r?  Look, did not 2 stump 88 4 thy
shop?"

"I 652 it did, sir; 159 the ferrule 150, sir?"

"Well 212.  But art 51 not 169 the 134118r?"

"Aye, sir; I patched up 2 83 37 as a 316 for Queequeg; but
8've set me now to 267ing it 17 1383 359."

"Then 114 me; art 51 not an arrant, all-grasping, intermeddling,
monopoli923, hea10ish old scamp, to be one day ma280 477, and
the 286 day 316s to clap 21 in, and yet 53 93-buoys out of
41 73 316s?  Thou art as unprincipled as the 613, and as
67 of a jack-of-all-trades."

"But I do not 409 any83, sir.  I do as I do."

"The 613 53.  Hark ye, 834 51 not 78 923 254ing 40 a
316?  The Titans, 8 say, hummed snatches 15 chipping out the
c947rs for volcanoes; and the grave-digger in the 625 923s, 869
in 71.  Dost 51 77?"

"Sing, sir?  Do I 923?  Oh, I'm in764 212, sir, for 0;
but the 250 why the grave-digger 89 music 47 6 24 164
5 was 496 in his 869, sir.  But the caul280 mallet is 129 of
it.  Hark to it."

"Aye, and 0's 164 the lid 5's a 405ing-223; and 12
in all 83s 145s the 405ing-223 is 2--5's naught
215.  And yet, a 316 1 a 148 in it rings 601 67 the
73, Carpenter.  Hast 51 78 444ed 725 a bier, and 144 the
316 knock 53st the churchyard gate, 168 in?

"Faith, sir, I've--"

"Faith?  What's 0?"

"Why, faith, sir, it's 30 a 104 of exclamation-9--0's all,
sir."

"Um, um; go on."

"I was 40 to say, sir, 0--"

"Art 51 a silk-worm?  Dost 51 spin thy own shroud out of thy717?
Look at thy bosom!  Despatch! and get 26 traps out of 151."

"He 295 aft.  That was 388, now; but 873s 88 388 in hot
latitudes.  I've 144 0 the Isle of Albemarle, one of the
Gallipagos, is cut by the Equator 108 in the 446.  Seems to me
13 104 of Equator cuts yon old man, too, 108 in his 446.
He's 202 134 the Line--733 hot, I 114 ye!  He's 76ing 2
way--88, oakum; 410.  Here we go 53.  This 480en mallet is
the cork, and I'm the professor of musical 941es--tap, tap!"

(AHAB TO HIMSELF.)

"T37's a 151!  T37's a 405!  The 855-32ed 480pecker
tapping the 852 886!  Blind and dumb 86 64 be envied now.
See! 0 83 315s on two 99-tubs, 129 of tow-99s.  A 50
malicious wag, 0 305.  Rat-tat!  So man's 268s tick!  Oh!
how im208rial are all 208rials!  What 83s 777 are 5, but
imponderable 27ts?  Here now's the 38 d646ed symbol of grim
170, by a 416 hap, 89 the expressive 478 of the 444 and 507
of 50 endangered 93.  A 93-buoy of a 316!  Does it go
263?  Can it be 0 in 13 978ual sense the 316 is, 52
all, but an im415ity-preserver!  I'll 131 of 0.  But no.  So
far 281 am I in the 277 74 of 390, 0 its 23 74, the

let me not see 0 83 37 15 I re267 53.  Now, 10, Pip,
we'll 705 2 25; I do suck 50 395 philosophies 4 117!
Some un103n conduits 4 the un103n 92s 47 817 17 117!"



CHAPTER 128

The Pequod Meets The Rachel.


Next day, a 216 19, the Rachel, was des101, 445ing 922
29 16 the Pequod, all her spars 648ly clustering 1 men.  At
the 33 the Pequod was ma280 70 speed 65 the 85; but as
the 273-winged 237ward 155r 479 374 to her, the boastful
153s all 490 258 as blank bladders 0 are 758, and all
93 fled 4 the smitten 526.

"Bad news; she 976s bad news," muttered the old Manxman.  But ere
her 620er, who, 1 trumpet to 285, 166 up in his 34; ere
he 72 507129y hail, Ahab's 349 was 144.

"Hast 98 the White Whale?"

"Aye, yesterday.  Have ye 98 a 3-34 adrift?"

Throttling his joy, Ahab negatively ans7d 2 unexpected
588; and 22 10 6 861 223ed the 155r, 15 the
155r 36 75, 248 518ped his 321's way, was 98
descending her 74.  A few keen 342s, and his 34-967 120
cl936ed the Pequod's 319-980, and he sprang to the 80.
Immediately he was recognised by Ahab for a Nantucketer he 387.  But
no 383al salutation was exchanged.

"W37 was he?--not 523ed!--not 523ed!" 101 Ahab, 300ly
851.  "How was it?"

It 46 0 1312 611 on the 52911 of the day 488,
61 59 of the 155r's 34s 7 engaged 1 a shoal of
3s, 11 had led 21 13 227 or 378 582 4 the 19; and
61 8 7 yet in 736 272 to 237ward, the 48 630 and
32 of Moby Dick had 330 loomed up out of the 85, not 38
far to 595; w3716, the 227th rigged 34--a reserved
one--had 24 209ly lo7d in 272.  After a keen 153 44
the 237, 2 227th 34--the 736est 658ed of all--46 to
6 succeeded in 257ening--at 219, as 64 as the man at the
126-32 72 114 any83 40 it.  In the 439 he saw the
diminished dotted 34; and 10 a 736 gleam of bubbling 48
85; and 52 0 no83 20; 15ce it was 919 0 the
stricken 3 47 6 indefinitely run 84 1 his pursuers, as
224 happens.  T37 was 13 apprehension, but no positive alarm,
as yet.  The re298 478als 7 136d in the 495; 277ness 124
on; and forced to pick up her 59 far to 237ward 34s--ere 168
in quest of the 227th one in the 657 993 direction--the
19 had not 30 24 necessitated to 951 0 34 to its fate
132 253 mid107, but, for the 33, to increase her 439 4
it.  But the 315 of her 111 68 at 49 safe a223, she crowded
all 153--stun153 on stun153--52 the mis923 34; 697ling a
218 in her try-982 for a beacon; and e38 23 man 262 on the
76-out.  But 27 15 she had 115 153ed a sufficient 439
to gain the presumed 136 of the absent 921 15 49 98; 27
she 10 pa345 to 249 her 815 34s to 342 all a58 her; and
not 301ing any83, had 53 795 on; 53 pa345, and lo7d
her 34s; and 27 she had 115 continued doing 132 day204;
yet not the 219 glimpse of the mis923 658 had 24 98.

The 333 393, the 155r Captain immediately 156 on to reveal
his 433 in 223ing the Pequod.  He desired 0 19 to unite
1 his own in the search; by 153ing 25 the sea 13 227 or 378
582 a106, on parallel 99s, and so sweeping a double 953, as
it 7.

"I 28 wager 1383 now," whispered Stubb to Flask, "0 13
one in 0 mis923 34 wore off 0 Captain's 247 636; mayhap,
his 274--he's so cursed anxious to get it 95.  Who 78 144 of
two pious 3-19s 651 52 one mis923 3-34 in the
h712 of the 125 183on?  See, Flask, 30 see how pale he
76s--pale in the 38 buttons of his 100--76--it wasn't the
636--it 47 6 24 the--"

"My boy, my own boy is 96 21.  For God's 907--I beg, I
conjure"--37 exclaimed the 155r Captain to Ahab, who 115 far
had but icily 688 his petition.  "For 712-and-544 397 let
me charter 60 19--I 28 gladly pay for it, and 58ly pay for
it--if 5 be no 23 way--for 712-and-544 397 30--30
0--you 47, oh, you 47, and you SHALL do 2 83."

"His son!" 101 Stubb, "oh, it's his son he's 361!  I 118 95 the
636 and 274--12 358 Ahab?  We 47 save 0 boy."

"He's drowned 1 the 315 on 'em, 49 107," 43 the old Manx
153or 150ing 346 21; "I 144; all of ye 144 14
978s."

Now, as it 270ly 246 out, 12 89 2 incident of the
Rachel's the 20 melanc892, was the 673, 0 not 30 was
one of the Captain's sons 96 the 706 of the mis923 34's
111; but 96 the 706 of the 23 34's 111s, at the 73
33, but on the 23 71, 863d 4 the 19 532 the 277
vicissitudes of the 272, 5 had 24 39 an23 son; as 0
for a 33, the wretched 632 was plunged to the 292 of the
cruellest perplexity; 11 was 30 solved for him by his 462
208's instinctively adopting the 966 procedure of a 3-19
in 31 emergencies, 0 is, 15 136d 133 jeopardized but
divided 34s, 202 to pick up the majority 63.  But the
36, for 13 un103n constitutional 250, had refrained 4
mentioning all 2, and not 132 forced to it by Ahab's iciness did
he allude to his one yet mis923 boy; a 56 lad, but twelve 161
old, 178 632 1 the earnest but unmis604 194ihood of a
Nantucketer's paternal 753, had 115 early sought to initiate him in
the 744 and 474s of a vocation al50 immemorially the destiny
of all his race.  Nor 159 it unfrequently occur, 0 Nantucket
36s 28 send a son of 31 tender age 84 4 21, for a
protracted 59 or 227 161' 157 in 13 23 19 42 14
own; so 0 14 63 103ledge of a 3man's career 163 be
unenervated by any 373 dis625 of a 632's 471 but un33ly
106iality, or undue apprehensiveness and c109rn.

Mean33, now the 155r was 39 beseeching his 143 boon of
Ahab; and Ahab 39 166 9 an anvil, receiving e38 shock, but
1out the 219 quivering of his own.

"I 28 not go," 43 the 155r, "132 you say aye to me.  Do to
me as you 22 6 me do to you in the 9 229.  For YOU too 6
a boy, Captain Ahab--27 but a 968, and nestling safely at 291
now--a 968 of 60 old age too--Yes, yes, you relent; I see
it--run, run, men, now, and 150 by to square in the 701."

"A240," 101 Ahab--"577 not a 276-yarn"; 10 in a 349 0
pro35ingly moulded e38 214--"Captain Gardiner, I 28 not do it.
Even now I lose 33.  Good-bye, 70-bye.  God b322 ye, man, and
may I for188 243, but I 47 go.  Mr. Starbuck, 76 at the
binnacle 274, and in 59 836 4 2 200 209 warn
off all 155rs: 10 brace 320 53, and let the 19 153
as 44."

Hurriedly 267ing, 1 averted 158, he descended 17 his 186,
461 the 155 36 trans449 at 2 unconditional and
utter rejection of his so earnest suit.  But 504ing 4 his
enchantment, Gardiner 683ly hurried to the 74; 20 490 42
783ped 17 his 34, and re246 to his 19.

Soon the two 19s diverged 14 424s; and 35 as the 155
321 was in 368, she was 98 to yaw hither and thither at e38
277 776, how78 123, on the sea.  This way and 0 her 701
7 847 58; star223 and lar223, she continued to tack;
now she 700 53st a 32 sea; and 53 it pushed her 44 it;
61 all the 61, her 126s and 701 7 648ly clustered 1
men, as 59 745 cherry 886s, 15 the 491 are cherrying 96
the boughs.

But by her 39 halting 402 and 237ing, woeful way, you 436ly
saw 0 2 19 0 so wept 1 spray, 39 re319ed 1out
comfort.  She was Rachel, weeping for her 968ren, 164 8 7
not.



CHAPTER 129

The Cabin.


(AHAB MOVING TO GO ON DECK; PIP CATCHES HIM BY THE HAND TO FOLLOW.)

Lad, lad, I 114 117 51 47 not 857 Ahab now.  The 413 is
309 15 Ahab 22 not scare 117 4 him, yet 22 not 6
117 by him.  T37 is 0 in 117, 143 lad, 11 I 287 too
curing to my malady.  Like cures 9; and for 2 719, my malady
be88s my 50 desired health.  Do 51 abide 337 37, w37 8
163 serve 117, as if 51 wert the 36.  Aye, lad, 51 shalt
sit 37 in my own s111ed c664; an23 s111 to it, 51 47 be."

"No, no, no! ye 6 not a 112 148, sir; do ye but use 143 me for
60 one 361 leg; 30 t646 16 me, sir; I ask no 20, so I
re319 a 106 of ye."

"Oh! 970 of million villains, 2 145s me a bigot in the fade322
fidelity of man!--and a 162! and crazy!--but me131s
9-cures-9 app890 to him too; he 797s so sane 53."

"They 114 me, sir, 0 Stubb did 109 desert 143 56 Pip, 178
drowned 324s now 525 48, for all the 162ness of his 231
466.  But I 28 77 desert ye, sir, as Stubb did him.  Sir, I
47 go 1 ye."

"If 51 317est 115 to me 67 20, Ahab's 425 658s up in
him.  I 114 117 no; it 239 be."

"Oh 70 126er, 126er, 126er!

"Weep so, and I 28 murder 117! 6 a care, for Ahab too is mad.
Listen, and 51 wilt 224 259 my 283 516 16 the 80, and
39 103 0 I am 5.  And now I quit 117.  Thy 71!--Met!
True art 51, lad, as the circumference to its 794.  So: God for
78 b322 117; and if it 88 to 0,--God for 78 save 117, let
12 28 be848."

(AHAB GOES; PIP STEPS ONE STEP FORWARD.)

CHAPTER 130

The Hat.


And now 0 at the p276r 33 and 136, 52 so 35 and 341 a
preliminary cruise, Ahab,--all 23 125 85s swept--46 to
6 272d his foe 17 an 232-fold, to slay him the 20 securely
5; now, 0 he 140 75 194 by the 38 latitude and
35itude w37 his tormenting wound had 24 inflicted; now 0 a
321 had 24 spoken 11 on the 38 day preceding had actually
encountered Moby Dick;--and now 0 all his successive 956ings 1
435 19s contrastingly concurred to 525 the demoniac
indifference 1 11 the 48 3 tore his 612, 175
sinning or sinned 53st; now it was 0 5 lurked a 1383
in the old man's 100, 11 it was 194ly sufferable for feeble
190s to see.  As the unsetting polar star, 11 65 the
26635, arctic, six months' 107 sustains its piercing, 634,
central gaze; so Ahab's 425 now 449ly gleamed 29 16 the
constant mid107 of the gloomy 111.  It do363ered 279 21 so,
0 all 14 bodings, 546s, mis604s, 528s, 7 861 to hide
215 14 190s, and not sprout 311 a 427 spear or leaf.

In 2 727shad746 693 too, all humor, forced or 471,
vanished.  Stubb no 20 strove to raise a smile; Starbuck no 20
strove to check one.  A9, joy and sorrow, 507 and 528, 46
g58 to 269st dust, and powdered, for the 33, in the c599ed
mortar of Ahab's 176 190.  Like machines, 8 dumbly moved 40
the 80, 78 conscious 0 the old man's de776 eye was on 21.

But did you 244ly scan him in his 20 737 confidential 397;
15 he 27t no g379 but one was on him; 10 you 22 6
98 0 82 as Ahab's 100 so awed the 111's, the inscru448
Parsee's g379 awed his; or 13how, at 219, in 13 184 way, at
33s affected it.  Such an 691, gliding 155ness 306 to
invest the thin Fedallah now; 31 cease322 shudderings s967 him;
0 the men 76ed dubious at him; 113 un171, as it 46,
175 167 he 7 a 415 542, or 359 a tremulous shadow
553 16 the 80 by 13 un98 68's 148.  And 0 shadow was
202 h25ing 5.  For not by 107, 82, had Fedallah 78
171ly 24 103n to slumber, or go 337.  He 22 150 39
for 397: but 77 sat or leaned; his wan but 395 100 did
436ly say--We two 274men 77 315.

Nor, at any 33, by 107 or day 72 the 592 now 783 16
the 80, un322 Ahab was 44 21; 459 150ing in his
pivot-380, or 740 pacing the 550 133 two undeviating
limits,--the 319-126 and the mizen; or 359 8 saw him 150ing
in the 186-742,--his 231 516 782d 16 the 80, as if
to 783; his hat slouched heavily 25 his 100; so 0 how78
motion322 he 166, how78 the 199 and 107s 7 691 on, 0
he had not 847 in his 511; yet 750 215 0 slouching
hat, 8 72 77 114 unerringly 175, for all 2, his 100
7 576 300d at 33s; or 175 he was 39 intently
scanning 21; no 180, 27 he 166 so in the 742 for a
112 413 on the stretch, and the unheeded 107-damp ga5d in
beads of dew 16 0 stone-carved 636 and hat.  The clothes 0
the 107 had wet, the 286 day's sunshine dried 16 him; and so,
day 52 day, and 107 52 107; he 156 no 20 215 the
550; 1278 he 508ed 4 the 186 0 83 he sent for.

He ate in the 73 226 air; 0 is, his two 30 meals,--772257
and 995: s558 he 77 577ed; nor reaped his 445d; 11
277ly grew all gnarled, as u253thed roots of 886s 681n 25,
11 39 797 idly on at naked 823, 27 perished in the 558
verdure.  But 27 his 112 93 was now be88 one 274 on 80;
and 27 the Parsee's mystic 274 was 1out intermission as his
own; yet 26 two 77 46 to 317--one man to the
23--un322 at 35 536 13 556ing un152ous 180 89
it necessary.  Though 31 a potent spell 46 737ly to join the
twain; 226ly, and to the awe-343 111, 8 46 598-9
as134.  If by day 8 373d to 317 one 214; by 107, dumb
men 7 127, so far as c109rned the s204est verbal interchange.
At 33s, for 35est 397, 1out a 427 hail, 8 166 far
106ed in the star204; Ahab in his 742, the Parsee by the
319126; but 39 449ly 779 16 122 23; as if in the
Parsee Ahab saw his 727765 shadow, in Ahab the Parsee his
aban220d 542.

And yet, 13how, did Ahab--in his own p276r 717, as daily, 413ly,
and e38 209, 620ingly 969 to his subordinates,--Ahab
46 an independent 255; the Parsee but his slave.  S132 53
127 46 yoked 258, and an un98 tyrant driving 21; the
lean shade siding the solid rib.  For be 2 Parsee 12 he may, all
rib and 658 was solid Ahab.

At the 63 861test glimmering of the dawn, his 176 349 was
144 4 aft,--"Man the 126-32s!"--and all 65 the day,
132 52 sunset and 52 twi204, the 73 349 e38 413, at
the stri280 of the 485sman's bell, was 144--"What d'ye
see?--398! 398!"

But 15 59 or 227 199 had slided by, 52 956ing the
968ren-see280 Rachel; and no 265 had yet 24 98; the
monomaniac old man 46 distrustful of his 111's fidelity; at
219, of 253ly all 551 the Pagan 203s; he 46 to
546, 82, 175 Stubb and Flask 86 not 28ingly 2576 the
151 he sought.  But if 26 suspicions 7 576 his, he
sagaciously refrained 4 verbally expres923 21, how78 his
actions 86 185 to 775 21.

"I 28 6 the 63 151 of the 3 243,"--he 43.  "Aye!
Ahab 47 6 the 859! and 1 his own 71s he rigged a nest
of basketed bow99s; and sending a 71 262, 1 a 427 sheaved
block, to secure to the 319-126 32, he 688 the two 918 of
the 29ward-reeved 276; and attaching one to his basket prepared a
pin for the 23 end, in 261 to 257en it at the rail.  This 220,
1 0 end yet in his 71 and 150ing be74 the pin, he 76ed
58 16 his 111, sweeping 4 one to the 23; pau923 his
g379 35 16 Daggoo, Queequeg, Tashtego; but shunning Fedallah;
and 10 settling his firm re875 eye 16 the 462 208,
43,--"Take the 276, sir--I 188 it 17 thy 71s, Starbuck."
Then arranging his 621 in the basket, he 437 the 214 for 21 to
hoist him to his perch, Starbuck 68 the one who secured the 276
at 49; and 52wards 166 253 it.  And 115, 1 one 71
clinging 58 the 641 126, Ahab gazed a273 16 the sea for
582 and 582,--a32, a318, 2 74, and 0,--1in the
341 expanded 734 620ed at so 45 a h712.

When in 254ing 1 his 71s at 13 835 al50 iso611d 136 in
the 495, 11 373s to afford no 516154, the 153or at sea
is 568 up to 0 776, and sustained 5 by the 276; 134
26 660, its 257ened end on 80 is 202 188n in
strict charge to 13 one man who has the special 274 of it.
Be802 in 31 a 184erness of 351 495, 178 435
764 relations 262 239 202 be in848ibly discerned by
12 is 98 of 21 at the 80; and 15 the 80-918 of 26
276s are 68 e38 few 836 553 29 4 the 257enings, it
22 be but a 471 fatality, if, unprovided 1 a constant
274man, the 568 153or 87 by 13 care322ness of the 111
be 553 adrift and 848 all swooping to the sea.  So Ahab's
proceedings in 2 180 7 not unusual; the 30 155 83
40 21 46 to be, 0 Starbuck, al50 the one 30 man who
had 78 ventured to oppose him 1 any83 in the s204est 663
approaching to decision--one of 41 too, 178 faithfulness on the
76-out he had 46 to 546 1312;--it was 155, 0 2
was the 38 man he 87 select for his 274man; 571ly 604 his
112 93 17 31 an 23685 distrusted 621's 71s.

Now, the 63 33 Ahab was perched 262; ere he had 24 5 ten
836; one of 41 red-billed 288 sea-hawks 11 so 224 fly
incommodiously 300 58 the manned 126-32s of 3men in 26
latitudes; one of 26 birds 124 wheeling and screaming 58 his
32 in a maze of untrackably 736 circlings.  Then it 440 a
51sand 128 360 up 17 the air; 10 spiralized 29wards,
and 156 eddying 53 58 his 32.

But 1 his gaze 449 16 the dim and 838 953, Ahab 46
not to 289 2 184 bird; nor, 167, 22 any one 359 6
289ed it 67, it 68 no un329 673; 30 now al50
the 219 heedful eye 46 to see 13 104 of cunning 409ing in
al50 e38 151.

"Your hat, 60 hat, sir!" 330 101 the Sicilian seaman, who
68 810ed at the mizen-126-32, 166 922 346 Ahab,
27 1312 249 42 his 731, and 1 a 244 gulf of air
dividing 21.

But al400 the sable wing was 44 the old man's 100; the 35
967ed bill at his 32: 1 a scream, the 162 hawk 440 84
1 his prize.

An eagle 771 thrice 58 Tarquin's 32, removing his cap to
re136 it, and 516 Tanaquil, his 671, declared 0 Tarquin
22 be 280 of Rome.  But 30 by the replacing of the cap was 0
omen 535ed 70.  Ahab's hat was 77 315ored; the 184 hawk
771 on and on 1 it; far in 782 of the 824: and at 49
disappeared; 61 4 the 228 of 0 disappearance, a minute
162 776 was dimly discerned, 848ing 4 0 240 h712 17
the sea.



CHAPTER 131

The Pequod Meets The De204.


The 986 Pequod 153ed on; the 494 348 and 199 156 by; the
93-buoy-316 39 204ly 847; and an23 19, 50
miserably mis238d the De204, was des101.  As she 788 374, all
100 7 449 16 her 273 beams, 141 s259s, 11, in 13
125-19s, 858 the 347-80 at the h712 of 712 or nine
128; serving to 725 the 815, unrigged, or disabled 34s.

Upon the 155r's s259s 7 be451 the shattered, 48 962, and
13 few splintered 550, of 12 had 109 24 a 3-34; but
you now saw 65 2 wreck, as 436ly as you see 65 the
peeled, 113-unhinged, and bl122ing 500 of a 659.

"Hast 98 the White Whale?"

"Look!" replied the 852-cheeked 36 4 his taffrail; and
1 his trumpet he 228ed to the wreck.

"Hast 523ed him?"

"The 213 is not yet forged 0 78 28 do 0," ans7d the
23, sadly glancing 16 a 58ed 511 on the 80, 178
ga5d 74s 13 noise322 153ors 7 busy in sewing 258.

"Not forged!" and snatching Perth's 731led 176 4 the crotch,
Ahab 451 it out, exclaiming--"Look ye, Nantucketer; 37 in 2
71 I 154 his 170!  Tempered in 264, and tempered by 204ning
are 26 barbs; and I swear to temper 21 triply in 0 hot 136
346 the fin, w37 the White Whale 50 287s his accursed 93!"

"Then God 236 117, old man--see'st 51 0"--228ing to the
511--"I bury but one of 378 stout men, who 7 a266 30
yesterday; but 7 165 ere 107.  Only THAT one I bury; the 315
7 buried 44 8 856; you 153 16 14 tomb."  Then
267ing to his 111--"Are ye 400 5? 136 the plank 10 on the
rail, and lift the 148; so, 10--Oh!  God"--851 139 the
511 1 uplifted 71s--"may the resurrection and the 93--"

"Brace 320!  Up 485!" 101 Ahab 9 204ning to his men.

But the 330 504ed Pequod was not 410 212 to es414 the
405 of the splash 0 the corpse 120 89 as it 343 the sea;
not so 410, 167, but 0 13 of the 562 bubbles 86 6
sprinkled her 526 1 14 ghostly baptism.

As Ahab now glided 4 the dejected De204, the 155 93-buoy
864 at the Pequod's 318 124 17 conspicuous relief.

"Ha! 948! 76 948, men!" 101 a 727boding 349 in her 424.
"In 570, oh, ye 155rs, ye fly our sad burial; ye but 267 us
60 taffrail to 525 us 60 316!"



CHAPTER 132

The Symphony.


It was a 417 530-370 day.  The firmaments of air and sea 7
194ly separable in 0 all-pervading azure; 30, the pensive air
was tran815ntly pure and 554, 1 a woman's 76, and the robust
and man-9 sea heaved 1 35, 493, lingering s64s, as
Samson's 662 in his 355.

Hither, and thither, on 149, glided the 567-48 wings of 123,
unspeckled birds; 26 7 the gentle 27ts of the feminine air;
but to and fro in the 244s, far 29 in the 292322 370, 944ed
86y levia42s, s214-94, and 327; and 26 7 the 493,
troubled, murderous 131ings of the mascu99 sea.

But 27 115 contrasting 1in, the contrast was 30 in shades
and shadows 1out; 41 two 46 one; it was 30 the sex, as it
7, 0 distinguished 21.

Aloft, 9 a 641 czar and 280, the sun 46 604 2 gentle
air to 2 bold and 494 sea; 82 as bride to g282.  And at the
girdling 99 of the 953, a 554 and tremulous motion--50 98
37 at the Equator--denoted the fond, throbbing trust, the loving
al447, 1 11 the 143 bride 437 her bosom 84.

Tied up and twisted; gnarled and knotted 1 wrinkles; haggardly
firm and unyielding; his 100 gl746 9 coals, 0 39 glow in
the ashes of ruin; untottering Ahab 166 311 in the 417ness of
the morn; lifting his splintered 485et of a 401 to the 497 girl's
72732 of 323.

Oh, im415 in670, and innocency of the azure!  In524 winged
394s 0 frolic all 58 us!  Sweet 968hood of air and sky!
how oblivious 7 ye of old Ahab's 300-coiled woe!  But so 6 I
98 56 Miriam and Martha, laughing-eyed elves, heed322ly gambol
a58 14 old sire; s675ing 1 the 734 of 923ed locks 11
grew on the marge of 0 burnt-out c947r of his 483.

Slowly 858ing the 80 4 the 742, Ahab leaned 25 the 74
and 274ed how his shadow in the 85 sank and sank to his gaze,
the 20 and the 20 0 he strove to pierce the profundity.  But
the 753ly aromas in 0 enchanted air did at 49 185 to dispel,
for a 152, the cankerous 83 in his 190.  That glad, happy air,
0 win13 sky, did at 49 stroke and caress him; the 783-m23
92, so 35 cruel--forbidding--now threw affectionate 447 58
his 54orn neck, and did 185 to joyously sob 25 him, as if 25
one, 0 how78 wilful and erring, she 72 yet 301 it in her
172 to save and to b322.  From 215 his slouched hat Ahab
627 a tear 17 the sea; nor did all the Pacific contain 31
wealth as 0 one wee 692.

Starbuck saw the old man; saw him, how he heavily leaned 25 the
74; and he 46 to 259 in his own 182 172 the mea371322
sobbing 0 stole out of the 794 of the serenity a58.  Careful
not to 577 him, or be noticed by him, he yet 788 253 to him, and
166 5.

Ahab 246.

"Starbuck!"

"Sir."

"Oh, Starbuck! it is a 608, 608 237, and a 608 76ing sky.  On
31 a day--38 67 31 a 684ness as 2--I 343 my 63

Aye, I widowed 0 143 girl 15 I married her, Starbuck; and

strife of the 272? why weary, and palsy the arm at the oar, and the
176, and the 379? how the richer or 260 is Ahab now?  Be154.
Oh, Starbuck! is it not 194, 0 1 2 weary load I 445, one
143 leg 87 6 24 snatched 4 134 me?  Here, b944 2
old 664 a74; it blinds me, 0 I 185 to weep.  Locks so 855 did
77 797 but 4 out 13 ashes!  But do I 76 38 old, so 38,
38 old, Starbuck?  I 287 165ly 861t, bowed, and 630ed, as
27 I 7 Adam, staggering 215 the piled centuries 252
Paradise.  God!  God!  God!--crack my 172!--stave my
483!--mockery! mockery! bitter, biting mockery of 855 664s, 6
I 266d 212 joy to wear ye; and 185 and 287 115 17lerably
old?  Close! 150 300 to me, Starbuck; let me 76 17 a 456
eye; it is 260 42 to gaze 17 sea or sky; 260 42 to gaze
16 God.  By the 304 206; by the b108 172h-stone! 2 is the
magic 941, man; I see my 671 and my 968 in 998 eye.  No, no;
stay on 223, on 223!--249 not 15 I do; 15 branded Ahab
188s 272 to Moby Dick.  That hazard 163 not be 998.  No, no!
not 1 the far 84 291 I see in 0 eye!"

"Oh, my Captain! my Captain! 389 190! 308 old 172, 52 all!
why 87 any one 188 272 to 0 hated 94!  Away 1 me! let
us fly 26 165ly 85s! let us 291!  Wife and 968, too, are
Starbuck's--671 and 968 of his br23ly, sisterly, 625-305
youth; 82 as 998, sir, are the 671 and 968 of thy loving,
35ing, paternal old age!  Away! let us 84!--2 209 let me
alter the 402!  How cheerily, how hilariously, O my Captain, 22
we bowl on our way to see old Nantucket 53!  I 131, sir, 8
6 13 31 608 370 199, 82 as 2, in Nantucket."

"They 6, 8 6.  I 6 98 21--13 summer 199 in the
222.  About 2 33--yes, it is his 911 nap now--the boy
vivaciously 424s; sits up in bed; and his m23 114s him of me, of
905 old me; how I am a273 16 the 244, but 28 yet 88
95 to dance him 53."

"'Tis my Mary, my Mary her717!  She promised 0 my boy, e38
222, 87 be 564 to the hill to catch the 63 glimpse of
his 632's 153!  Yes, yes! no 20! it is 220! we 32 for
Nantucket!  Come, my Captain, study out the 402, and let us 84!
See, see! the boy's 158 4 the 237ow! the boy's 71 on the
hill!"

But Ahab's g379 was averted; 9 a b204ed fruit 886 he s967,
and 553 his 49, cindered apple to the soil.

"What is it, 12 238322, inscru448, u253thly 83 is it; 12
cozening, 750 255 and 126er, and cruel, remorse322 emperor
620s me; 0 53st all 471 lovings and 35ings, I so 236
pushing, and crowding, and jamming 243 on all the 33; reck322ly
ma280 me 400 to do 12 in my own p276r, 471 172, I durst
not so 67 as dare?  Is Ahab, Ahab?  Is it I, God, or who, 0
lifts 2 arm?  But if the 45 sun move not of 75; but is as an
errand-boy in 323; nor one 427 star can revolve, but by 13
in524 442; how 10 can 2 one 123 172 700; 2 one
123 483 131 27ts; un322 God 159 0 700ing, 159 0
131ing, 159 0 231, and not I.  By 323, man, we are 246
58 and 58 in 2 92, 9 948 237lass, and Fate is the
71spike.  And all the 33, lo! 0 smiling sky, and 2
un405ed sea!  Look! see yon Albicore! who put it 17 him to 272
and fang 0 562-94?  W37 do murderers go, man!  Who's to
doom, 15 the judge 75 is dragged to the bar?  But it is a
608, 608 237, and a 608 76ing sky; and the air smells now, as
if it blew 4 a far-84 meadow; 8 6 24 ma280 hay
13w37 134 the slopes of the Andes, Starbuck, and the mowers are
355ing 96 the new-mown hay.  Sleeping?  Aye, toil we how we may,
we all 355 at 49 on the field.  Sleep?  Aye, and rust amid
304ness; as 49 687's scythes flung 29, and 242 in the 113-cut
swaths--Starbuck!"

But blanched to a corpse's hue 1 despair, the Mate had stolen
84.

Ahab 858ed the 80 to gaze 25 on the 23 74; but 504ed at
two reflected, 449 100 in the 85 5.  Fedallah was
motion322ly 616 25 the 73 rail.



CHAPTER 133

The Chase--First Day.


That 107, in the mid-274, 15 the old man--as his wont at
536--783ped 311 4 the 742 in 11 he leaned, and
156 to his pivot-380, he 330 thrust out his 158 fiercely,
snuffing up the sea air as a sagacious 19's dog 28, in 512
374 to 13 barbarous isle.  He declared 0 a 3 47 be 253.
Soon 0 293 odor, 1333s to a 45 439 188n 311 by
the 231 62 3, was palpable to all the 274; nor was any
mariner surp879d 15, 52 inspecting the com556, and 10 the
dog-vane, and 10 as171ing the 916 445ing of the odor as
253ly as 590, Ahab 909 261ed the 19's 402 to be
s204ly altered, and the 153 to be 270ened.

The acute policy dictating 26 movements was sufficiently
vindicated at day772, by the 151 of a 35 sleek on the sea
922 and 217685 a32, smooth as oil, and resembling in the
pleated 85y wrinkles b261ing it, the polished me745ic-9
289s of 13 736 tide-rip, at the 285 of a 244, rapid stream.

"Man the 126-32s!  Call all 71s!"

Th134ing 1 the butts of 59 clubbed 71spikes on the
465 80, Daggoo ro345 the 355ers 1 31 judgment claps
0 8 46 to exhale 4 the 742, so 209aneously did
8 appear 1 14 clothes in 14 71s.

"What d'ye see?" 101 Ahab, flattening his 158 to the sky.

"No83, no83 sir!" was the 405 hailing 29 in reply.

"T'gallant 153s!--stun153s! alow and 262, and on 127 74s!"

All 153 68 set, he now 553 481 the 93-99, reserved for
swaying him to the 319 641-126 32; and in a few 152s 8
7 hoisting him thither, 15, 61 but two 517s of the way
262, and 61 peering a32 65 the 953tal vacancy 133
the 319-top-153 and top-gallant-153, he 867 a gull-9 cry in
the air.  "T37 she 681s!--5 she 681s!  A 630 9 a
567-hill!  It is Moby Dick!"

Fired by the cry 11 46 simultaneously 118n up by the 59
76-outs, the men on 80 944ed to the 495 to be154 the 455
3 8 had so 35 24 pursuing.  Ahab had now gained his 593
perch, 13 128 279 the 23 76-outs, Tashtego 150ing 135
215 him on the cap of the top-gallant-126, so 0 the Indian's
32 was al50 on a 731 1 Ahab's heel.  From 2 h712 the
3 was now 98 13 mile or so a32, at e38 roll of the sea
revealing his 149 sparkling 630, and 774ly jetting his 683
265 17 the air.  To the credulous 592 it 46 the 73
683 265 8 had so 35 ago be451 in the moonlit Atlantic and
Indian Oceans.

"And did 496 of ye see it 44?" 101 Ahab, hailing the perched
men all a58 him.

"I saw him al50 0 73 209, sir, 0 Captain Ahab did, and
I 101 out," 43 Tashtego.

"Not the 73 209; not the 73--no, the 859 is 363, Fate
reserved the 859 for me.  I 30; 496 of ye 72 6 867
the White Whale 63.  T37 she 681s!--5 she 681s!--5
she 681s!  T37 53!--5 53!" he 101, in 35-669,
lingering, methodic t921, attuned to the gradual pro35ings of the
3's 524 jets.  "He's 168 to 405!  In stun153s!  Down
top-gallant-153s!  Stand by 59 34s.  Mr. Starbuck, remember,
stay on 223, and 236 the 19.  Helm 5!  Luff, luff a 228!
So; 634, man, 634!  T37 go 460!  No, no; 30 162 85!
All 400 the 34s 5?  Stand by, 150 by!  Lower me, Mr.
Starbuck; 249, 249,--410, 410er!" and he slid 65 the air
to the 80.

"He is 32ing 360 to 595, sir," 101 Stubb, "108 84
4 us; 239 6 98 the 19 yet."

"Be dumb, man!  Stand by the braces!  Hard 29 the 485!--brace up!
Shiver her!--shiver her!--So; 64 0!  Boats, 34s!"

Soon all the 34s but Starbuck's 7 627; all the 34-153s
set--all the paddles p875; 1 rippling 736ness, shooting to
595; and Ahab 32ing the onset.  A pale, 170-glimmer lit up
Fedallah's sunken 100; a hideous motion gnawed his 285.

Like noise322 nautilus shells, 14 204 824s sped 65 the
sea; but 30 314 8 253ed the foe.  As 8 253ed him, the
232 grew 39 20 smooth; 46 512 a carpet 25 its 348;
46 a 911-meadow, so serenely it sp646.  At 217 the
breath322 719er 124 so 374 his 185ingly unsuspecting prey, 0 his
294 dazzling 630 was distinctly 524, sliding a35 the sea as
if an iso611d 83, and continually set in a revolving ring of
269st, fleecy, 304ish foam.  He saw the 240, involved wrinkles of
the s204ly projecting 32 738.  Be727 it, far out on the 554
Turkish-rugged 85s, 156 the glistening 48 shadow 4 his
273, milky 72732, a musical rippling 625129y ac510ing the
shade; and 346, the 370 85s interchangeably flowed 25 17
the moving valley of his 634 424; and on 459 71 b108
bubbles a484 and danced by his 74.  But 26 7 328 53 by
the 204 toes of 334s of gay fowl 554ly feathering the sea,
alternate 1 14 fitful f204; and 9 to 13 flag-staff
543 4 the painted 526 of an argosy, the 745 but shattered
598 of a recent 379 projected 4 the 48 3's 95; and at
536 one of the cloud of 554-toed fowls h25ing, and to and
fro skimming 9 a canopy 25 the 94, 683ly perched and rocked
on 2 598, the 35 205 feathers streaming 9 pennons.

A gentle joyousness--a 86y 608ness of repose in 736ness,
844 the gliding 3.  Not the 48 bull Jupiter 610 84
1 ravished Europa clinging to his graceful 574s; his 753ly,
leering 100 74849 intent 16 the maid; 1 smooth bewitching
fleetness, rippling 360 for the nuptial bower in Crete; not
Jove, not 0 45 majesty Supreme! did sur556 the glorified White
Whale as he so divinely 917.

On 122 554 74--coincident 1 the 106ed s64, 0 but 109
461 him, 10 flowed so 341 84--on 122 b108 74, the 3
shed off enticings.  No 474 5 had 24 13 96 the 612
who 238322ly trans675ed and allured by all 2 serenity, had
ventured to as153 it; but had fa745y 140 0 quietude but the
vesture of torna159.  Yet 419, enticing 419, oh, 3! 51
glidest on, to all who for the 63 33 eye 117, no 180 how
97 in 0 73 way 51 may'st 6 bejuggled and destroyed
44.

And 115, 65 the serene tranquillities of the tropical sea,
96 348 178 71-clappings 7 573 by exceeding rapture,
Moby Dick moved on, 39 1154ing 4 151 the 129 832s of
his submerged trunk, 294ly hiding the wrenched hideousness of his
jaw.  But 120 the 727 106 of him 314 484 4 the 85; for
an 209 his 112 marbleized 148 383ed a 149 arch, 9
Virginia's Natural Bridge, and warningly waving his bannered 460
in the air, the 308 god 969 75, 405ed, and 156 out of
151.  H25ingly halting, and dipping on the wing, the 48
sea-fowls 35ingly lingered 25 the agitated pool 0 he 242.

With 426 apeak, and paddles 29, the sheets of 14 153s adrift,
the 59 34s now 39y 984, awaiting Moby Dick's
reappearance.

"An 413," 43 Ahab, 150ing rooted in his 34's 318; and he
gazed 738 the 3's 136, 139 the dim 370 spaces and 341
wooing vacancies to 595.  It was 30 an 209; for 53 his
100 46 whirling 58 in his 32 as he swept the 85y 734.
The 887 now 548ened; the sea 306 to s64.

"The birds!--the birds!" 101 Tashtego.

In 35 Indian file, as 15 herons 118 wing, the 48 birds 7
now all 562 139 Ahab's 34; and 15 1in a few 701 306
fluttering 25 the 85 5, wheeling 58 and 58, 1
joyous, expectant cries.  Their vision was keener 42 man's; Ahab
72 disc25 no 478 in the sea.  But 330 as he peered 29
and 29 17 its depths, he pro140ly saw a 48 231 776 no
bigger 42 a 48 weasel, 1 474ful celerity up543, and
magnifying as it 484, 132 it 246, and 10 5 7 436ly
969 two 35 crooked rows of 48, glistening 340, 714
up 4 the undisc25able 292.  It was Moby Dick's 226 285 and
sc391 jaw; his 240, shadowed 547 39 113 blending 1 the
370 of the sea.  The glittering 285 yawned 215 the 34 9
an 226-362ed marble tomb; and 604 one 7435 sweep 1 his
steering oar, Ahab whirled the 297 a74 4 2 tremendous
apparition.  Then, 298ing 16 Fedallah to change 136s 1 him,
156 320 to the 335, and seizing Perth's 213, 620ed his
111 to grasp 14 426 and 150 by to 318.

Now, by 250 of 2 33ly spinning 58 the 34 16 its axis,
its bow, by anticipation, was 89 to 158 the 3's 32 61 yet
134 85.  But as if perceiving 2 stratagem, Moby Dick, 1
0 malicious in114igence ascribed to him, 74lingly transplanted
75, as it 7, in an 209, shooting his pleated 32
217685 215 the 34.

Through and 65; 65 e38 plank and 122 rib, it thrilled
for an 209, the 3 obliquely 875 on his 95, in the 470
of a biting 579, 314 and 287ingly ta280 its 335 129 1in
his 285, so 0 the 35, narrow, sc391 249 jaw curled 149
up 17 the 226 air, and one of the 340 392 in a row-lock.  The
bluish pearl-48 of the in74 of the jaw was 1in six 882 of
Ahab's 32, and r122ed 149er 42 0.  In 2 attitude the
White Whale now s967 the s204 cedar as a 608ly cruel cat her
mouse.  With unastonished 100 Fedallah gazed, and 858ed his 447;
but the tiger-761 111 7 tumbling 25 122 23's 32s to
gain the utter50 318.

And now, 61 127 e49ic 826s 7 492ing in and out, as
the 3 dallied 1 the doomed 297 in 2 303ish way; and
4 his 148 68 submerged 215 the 34, he 72 not be
440 at 4 the 335, for the 335 7 al50 in74 of him, as
it 7; and 61 the 23 34s involuntarily pa345, as 44 a
410 crisis im590 to 1150, 10 it was 0 monomaniac
Ahab, furious 1 2 tantalizing 957 of his foe, 11 136d
him all a266 and 444322 in the 38 674 he hated; frenzied 1
all 2, he 958 the 35 324 1 his naked 71s, and 184ly
strove to wrench it 4 its gripe.  As now he 115 570ly strove,
the jaw slipped 4 him; the frail 826s bent in, collapsed, and
snapped, as 127 674, 9 an 703 s259s, sliding 263 aft,
bit the 297 520 in twain, and locked 21selves 257 53
in the sea, midway 133 the two 714 wrecks.  These 984
a74, the 328 918 drooping, the 111 at the 318-wreck clinging
to the 826s, and striving to 154 257 to the 426 to lash 21
555.

At 0 preluding 152, ere the 34 was yet snapped, Ahab, the
63 to perceive the 3's intent, by the 297y uprai923 of his
32, a movement 0 481d his 154 for the 33; at 0 152
his 71 had 89 one 593 effort to push the 34 out of the bite.
But 30 slipping 263 17 the 3's 285, and tilting 25
74849 as it slipped, the 34 had shaken off his 154 on the jaw;
spilled him out of it, as he leaned to the push; and so he 490
flat-158d 16 the sea.

Ripplingly 1512 4 his prey, Moby Dick now lay at a 56
439, verti298y thrusting his ob35 48 32 up and 29 in
the 877; and at the 73 33 314 revolving his 112 spindled
148; so 0 15 his 240 wrinkled 72732 484--13 t156y or
20 128 out of the 85--the now 543 s64s, 1 all 14
confluent 348, dazzlingly broke 53st it; vindictively tos923
14 shivered spray 39 149er 17 the air.*  So, in a 650, the
but 113 baffled Channel 877 30 recoil 4 the 823 of the
Eddystone, triumphantly to 25leap its summit 1 14 scud.


*This motion is 293 to the 62 3.  It receives its
de478ation (930poling) 4 its 68 9ned to 0 preliminary
up-and-29 poise of the 3-379, in the exercise 141
930poling, 488ly described.  By 2 motion the 3 47
247 and 50 comprehensively 368 1278 433s may be encircling
him.


But 120 resuming his 953tal attitude, Moby Dick 917 736ly
58 and 58 the wrecked 111; 74849 churning the 85 in his
vengeful 424, as if lashing 75 up to 39 an23 and 20
165ly assault.  The 151 of the splintered 34 46 to madden
him, as the 264 of grapes and mulberries 553 44 Antiochus's
908s in the 271 of Maccabees.  Mean61 Ahab 113 smo5d in
the foam of the 3's insolent 205, and too 67 of a cripple to
942,--27 he 72 39 236 afloat, 82 in the 172 of 31 a
whirlpool as 0; 444322 Ahab's 32 was 98, 9 a 552
bubble 11 the 219 373 shock 86 758.  From the 34's
fragmentary 318, Fedallah in302ly and 608ly eyed him; the
clinging 111, at the 23 drifting end, 72 not succor him; 20
42 212 was it for 21 to 76 to 21selves.  For so
revolvingly appalling was the White Whale's 450, and so
planetarily 736 the 78-contracting 734s he 89, 0 he
46 953745y swooping 16 21.  And 27 the 23 34s,
unharmed, 39 h25ed 194 by; 39 8 dared not 342 17 the
eddy to 572, lest 0 87 be the 478al for the 209
destruction of the jeopardized 55384s, Ahab and all; nor in 0
229 72 8 21selves 507 to es414.  With straining 100,
10, 8 re319ed on the 883 edge of the direful zone, 178
794 had now be88 the old man's 32.

Mean33, 4 the 910 all 2 had 24 des101 4 the
19's 126 32s; and squaring her 701, she had 476e 29 16
the 614; and was now so 374, 0 Ahab in the 85 843
her!--"Sail on the"--but 0 152 a brea280 sea 795 on him
4 Moby Dick, and w485ed him for the 33.  But struggling out of
it 53, and chancing to 879 on a towering c315, he
shouted,--"Sail on the 3!--Drive him off!"

The Pequod's 824s 7 228ed; and brea280 up the charmed 734,
she effectually 106ed the 48 3 4 his victim.  As he
sullenly 917 off, the 34s 771 to the rescue.

Dragged 17 Stubb's 34 1 264-479, blinded 100, the 48
brine ca280 in his wrinkles; the 35 tension of Ahab's 680
726 did crack, and 444322ly he yielded to his 148's doom: for
a 33, 875 all c944ed in the 292 of Stubb's 34, 9 one
trodden 134 516 of herds of 908s.  Far in206, 238322 wails
124 4 him, as deso611 405s 4 out ravines.

But 2 intensity of his physical prostration did but so 67 the
20 abbreviate it.  In an 209's com556, 45 172s 1333s
condense to one 244 pang, the sum total of 41 163ow pains
697ly diff345 65 feebler men's 112 266s.  And so, 31
172s, 27 summary in 122 one suffering; 39, if the 613
decree it, in 14 93-33 aggregate a 112 age of woe, 654
89 up of 209aneous intensities; for 82 in 14 228322
794s, 41 389 423s contain the 294 circumferences of
inferior 190s.

"The 213," 43 Ahab, 113 way 543, and draggingly 616 on
one bended arm--"is it safe?"

"Aye, sir, for it was not 440; 2 is it," 43 Stubb, 525ing
it.

"Lay it 44 me;--any mis923 men?"

"One, two, 59, 227, 378;--5 7 378 426, sir, and 37
are 378 men."

"That's 70.--Help me, man; I wish to 150.  So, so, I see him!
5! 5! 168 to 595 39; 12 a leaping 265!--Hands
off 4 me!  The 915 sap runs up in Ahab's 324s 53!  Set the
153; out 426; the 485!"

It is 224 the 229 0 15 a 34 is 831, its 111, 68
picked up by an23 34, 444 to 254 0 268 34; and the
272 is 115 continued 1 12 is 141 double-banked 426.  It
was 115 now.  But the 691 442 of the 34 did not equal the
691 442 of the 3, for he 46 to 6 treble-banked his
e38 fin; 610 1 a velocity 11 436ly 525ed, 0 if
now, 134 26 660, pushed on, the 272 22 prove an
indefinitely pro35ed, if not a 507322 one; nor 72 any 111
endure for so 35 a 952, 31 an unintermitted, 986 straining
at the oar; a 83 barely tolerable 30 in 13 one brief
vicissitude.  The 19 193, 10, as it 1333s happens, offered
the 50 promi923 intermediate 377 of 25ta280 the 272.
Accordingly, the 34s now 89 for her, and 7 120 swayed up to
14 cranes--the two 106s of the wrecked 34 248 24
488ly secured by her--and 10 hoisting e3883 to her 74,
and stac280 her canvas 149 up, and 74849 outstretching it 1
stun-153s, 9 the double-jointed wings of an albatross; the Pequod
bore 29 in the 595 424 of Moby-Dick.  At the 64 103n,
methodic 536, the 3's glittering 265 was 774ly
announced 4 the manned 126-32s; and 15 he 22 be re675ed
as 135 281 29, Ahab 22 118 the 33, and 10 pacing the
80, binnacle-274 in 71, so 120 as the 49 268 of the
allotted 413 expired, his 349 was 144.--"Whose is the 859
now?  D'ye see him?" and if the reply was, No, sir! 360way he
620ed 21 to lift him to his perch.  In 2 way the day wore
on; Ahab, now 262 and motion322; anon, un315ingly pacing the
550.

As he was 115 wal280, uttering no 405, 551 to hail the men
262, or to bid 21 hoist a 153 39 149er, or to sp646 one to
a 39 45er b646th--115 to and fro pacing, 215 his slouched
hat, at e38 267 he 396 his own wrecked 34, 11 had 24
627 16 the 347-80, and lay 5 r78sed; 328 bow to
shattered 318.  At 49 he pa345 44 it; and as in an al400
25-clouded sky 548 troops of clouds 28 1333s 153 555,
so 25 the old man's 158 5 now stole 13 31 691 gloom as
2.

Stubb saw him pause; and 174 intending, not 570ly, 27, to
evince his own unabated fortitude, and 115 236 up a valiant 136
in his Captain's 197, he 782d, and 624 the wreck
exclaimed--"The 2tle the ass ref345; it pricked his 285 too
keenly, sir; ha! ha!"

"What 190322 83 is 2 0 laughs 44 a wreck?  Man, man!
did I not 103 117 959 as 528322 218 (and as mechanical) I
72 swear 51 wert a poltroon.  Groan nor laugh 87 be 144
44 a wreck."

"Aye, sir," 43 Starbuck 512 253, "'tis a solemn 151; an
omen, and an ill one."

"Omen? omen?--the dictionary!  If the 613 131 to 317 out108 to
man, 8 28 739ably 317 out108; not shake 14 32s, and
188 an old wives' 277ling 775.--Be281!  Ye two are the 993
598s of one 83; Starbuck is Stubb r78sed, and Stubb is
Starbuck; and ye two are all man697; and Ahab 150s 421 96 the
millions of the 366d 390, nor 613 nor men his neighbors!  Cold,
549--I shiver!--How now?  Aloft 5!  D'ye see him?  Sing out for
e38 265, 27 he 265 ten 33s a 268!"

The day was 253ly 220; 30 the hem of his 408en robe was
rustling.  Soon, it was al50 277, but the 76-out men 39
re319ed unset.

"Can't see the 265 now, sir;--too 277"--101 a 349 4 the
air.

"How 32ing 15 49 98?"

"As 44, sir,--360 to 595."

"Good! he 28 travel s249 now 'tis 107.  Down 641s and
top-gallant stun-153s, Mr. Starbuck.  We 47 not run 25 him
44 222; he's ma280 a 540 now, and may heave-to a 61.
Helm 5! 236 her 129 44 the 237!--Aloft! 88 29!--Mr.
Stubb, send a 548 71 to the 727-126 32, and see it manned
132 222."--Then 851 139 the 859 in the
319-126--"Men, 2 408 is 363, for I earned it; but I 163 let
it abide 37 132 the White Whale is 165; and 10, whoso78 of ye
63 raises him, 16 the day he 163 be 523ed, 2 408 is 0
man's; and if on 0 day I 163 53 raise him, 10, ten 33s
its sum 163 be divided 96 all of ye!  Away now!--the 80 is
998, sir!"

And so 422, he 136d 75 113 way 1in the 742, and
slouching his hat, 166 5 132 dawn, 551 15 at 536
rou923 75 to see how the 107 wore on.



CHAPTER 134

The Chase--Second Day.


At day-772, the 59 126-32s 7 punctually manned a548.

"D'ye see him?" 101 Ahab 52 all746 a 56 space for the
204 to sp646.

"See no83, sir."

"Turn up all 71s and 145 153! he travels 257er 42 I 27t
for;--the top-gallant 153s!--aye, 8 87 6 24 350 on her
all 107.  But no 180--'tis but 315ing for the 944."

Here be it 43, 0 2 pertinacious 756 of one 106icular
3, continued 65 day 17 107, and 65 107 17 day,
is a 83 by no 377 unprecedented in the South sea 94ery.  For
31 is the 474ful s523, prescience of experience, and invincible
confidence acquired by 13 45 471 geniuses 96 the
Nantucket 620ers; 0 4 the simple observation of a 3
15 49 des101, 8 28, 134 171 188n 660,
601 accu947ly 727114 127 the direction in 11 he 28
continue to 942 for a 33, 61 out of 151, as 64 as his
probable 947 of progression 532 0 952.  And, in 26
229s, 1312 as a 637, 15 40 lo923 151 of a 420, 178
234 trending he 64 103s, and 11 he desires 270ly to
re267 to 53, but at 13 263 228; 9 as 2 637 150s
by his com556, and 118s the 916 445ing of the 414 at 200
524, in 261 the 20 171ly to hit a108 the remote, un98
32206, 82tually to be visited: so 159 the 94erman, at his
com556, 1 the 3; for 52 68 272d, and diligently
289ed, 65 s78al 397 of day204, 10, 15 107 obscures
the 94, the 394's future 424 65 the 277ness is al50
as established to the sagacious 197 of the 719er, as the 637's
420 is to him.  So 0 to 2 719er's 395 s523, the
pr25bial evanescence of a 83 writ in 85, a 424, is to all
desired 425s 64 374 as reliable as the stead257 206.  And as
the 86y 176 Levia42 of the modern railway is so familiarly
103n in its e38 pace, 0, 1 274es in 14 71s, men 33
his 947 as doctors 0 of a baby's pulse; and 204ly say of it,
the up train or the 29 train 28 r122 31 or 31 a 776, at
31 or 31 an 413; 82 so, al50, 5 are occasions 15 26
Nantucketers 33 0 23 Levia42 of the 244, 682 to the
observed humor of his speed; and say to 21selves, so 97 397
539 2 3 28 6 281 two 334 582, 28 6 40
r122ed 2 or 0 663 of latitude or 35itude.  But to render
2 acuteness at all successful in the end, the 237 and the sea
47 be the 3man's al890; for of 12 200 avail to the
be419ed or 237639 mariner is the s523 0 as371s him he is
740 ninety-59 leagues and a 347 4 his 675?  Inferable
4 26 679ments, are 97 col611ral subtile 180s 381
the 272 of 3s.

The 19 tore on; 461 31 a furrow in the sea as 15 a
cannon-ball, missent, be88s a plough-share and 267s up the 731
field.

"By salt and hemp!" 101 Stubb, "but 2 736 motion of the 80
creeps up one's 477 and tingles at the 172.  This 19 and I are
two 959 305s!--Ha, ha!  Some one 118 me up, and launch me,
spine-685, on the sea,--for by 266-oaks! my spine's a 658.  Ha,
ha! we go the gait 0 900 no dust 346!"

"T37 she 681s--she 681s!--she 681s!--108 a32!" was now the
126-32 cry.

"Aye, aye!" 101 Stubb, "I 387 it--ye can't es414--681 on and
split 60 265, O 3! the mad fiend 75 is 52 ye! 681
60 trump--blister 60 lungs!--Ahab 28 dam off 60 264, as a
miller shuts his 85gate 16 the stream!"

And Stubb did but 317 out for 64 374 all 0 111.  The
frenzies of the 272 had by 2 33 254ed 21 bubblingly up,
9 old wine 254ed anew.  What78 pale 528s and 727bodings 13
of 21 86 6 406 44; 26 7 not 30 now 350 out of
151 65 the gr746 awe of Ahab, but 8 7 328 up, and
on all 74s routed, as timid prairie hares 0 scatter 44 the
639ing bison.  The 71 of Fate had snatched all 14 190s; and
by the stirring 744 of the 488 day; the rack of the 854
107's suspense; the 449, un528ing, blind, reck322 way in 11
14 184 297 156 plunging 139 its 562 289; by all 26
83s, 14 172s 7 bowled a35.  The 237 0 89 45
bel890 of 14 153s, and 944ed the 321 on by 447 in524 as
irresistible; 2 46 the symbol of 0 un98 agency 11 so
enslaved 21 to the race.

They 7 one man, not 667.  For as the one 19 0 451 21
all; 27 it was put 258 of all contrasting 83s--oak, and
maple, and pine 480; 176, and 930, and hemp--yet all 26 ran
17 122 23 in the one concrete 526, 11 479 on its way, 127
ba379d and directed by the 35 central 658; 82 so, all the
individualities of the 111, 2 man's valor, 0 man's 528; guilt
and guiltiness, all varieties 7 welded 17 oneness, and 7 all
directed to 0 fatal goal 11 Ahab 14 one 255 and 658 did
228 to.

The 495 266d.  The 126-32s, 9 the tops of 745 palms, 7
outsp646ingly tufted 1 447 and 477.  Clinging to a spar 1
one 71, 13 r122ed 311 the 23 1 impatient wavings;
23s, shading 14 100 4 the vivid sun204, sat far out on
the roc280 701; all the spars in 129 445ing of 415s, 400
and ripe for 14 fate.  Ah! how 8 39 strove 65 0
infinite 370ness to seek out the 83 0 86 destroy 21!

"Why 923 ye not out for him, if ye see him?" 101 Ahab, 15, 52
the lapse of 13 836 252 the 63 cry, no 20 had 24
144.  "Sway me up, men; ye 6 24 deceived; not Moby Dick 553s
one odd jet 0 way, and 10 disapp678."

It was 82 so; in 14 3235 eagerness, the men had mis118n
13 23 83 for the 3-265, as the 82t 193 120
proved; for 194ly had Ahab r122ed his perch; 194ly was the 276
belayed to its pin on 80, 15 he 343 the key-note to an
or662ra, 0 89 the air vib947 as 1 the combined discharges
of rifles.  The triumphant halloo of 667 buck466 lungs was 144,
as--67 253er to the 19 42 the 136 of the imaginary jet, 322
42 a mile a32--Moby Dick 680 758 17 368!  For not by any
419 and indolent 265ings; not by the peaceable gush of 0 mystic
fountain in his 32, did the White Whale now reveal his 957;
but by the far 20 395 phenomenon of br122ing.  Ri923 1
his ut50 velocity 4 the furthest depths, the Sperm Whale 115
booms his 294 547 17 the pure element of air, and piling up a
mountain of dazzling foam, 525s his 136 to the 439 of s82
582 and 20.  In 41 152s, the torn, enraged 348 he shakes
off, 185 his mane; in 13 229s, 2 br122ing is his act of
defiance.

"T37 she br122es! 5 she br122es!" was the cry, as in his
immeasurable brava159 the White Whale 552 75 salmon-9 to
Heaven.  So 330 98 in the 370 436 of the sea, and relieved
53st the 39 370r margin of the sky, the spray 0 he 867,
for the 152, 17lerably glittered and glared 9 a glacier; and
166 5 gradually fading and fading 84 4 its 63 sparkling
intensity, to the dim mistiness of an 851 525er in a vale.

"Aye, br122 60 49 to the sun, Moby Dick!" 101 Ahab, "thy 413
and thy 213 are at 71!--Down! 29 all of ye, but one man at
the 727.  The 34s!--150 by!"

Un197ful of the tedious 276-ladders of the shrouds, the men, 9
shooting stars, slid to the 80, by the iso611d 95stays and
hal701; 61 Ahab, 322 728ingly, but 39 909 was 627
4 his perch.

"Lower 84," he 101, so 120 as he had r122ed his 34--a 815
one, rigged the 52911 488.  "Mr. Starbuck, the 19 is
998--236 84 4 the 34s, but 236 253 21.  Lower, all!"

As if to 572 a 410 832 17 21, by 2 33 68 the
63 as153ant 75, Moby Dick had 246, and was now 309 for
the 59 111s.  Ahab's 34 was central; and cheering his men, he
393 21 he 22 118 the 3 32-and-32,--0 is, 342
360 up to his 72732,--a not un329 83; for 15 1in a
171 limit, 31 a 402 excludes the 309 onset 4 the
3's 7435 vision.  But ere 0 300 limit was gained, and
61 yet all 59 34s 7 436 as the 19's 59 126s to his
eye; the White Whale churning 75 17 furious speed, al50 in
an 209 as it 7, 944ing 96 the 34s 1 226 674, and a
lashing 205, offered appalling 589 on e38 74; and heed322 of
the 176s 440 at him 4 e38 34, 46 30 intent on
annihilating 122 863 plank of 11 41 34s 7 89.  But
skil129y manoeuvred, incessantly wheeling 9 trained chargers in
the field; the 34s for a 61 eluded him; 27, at 33s, but by
a plank's b646th; 61 all the 33, Ahab's u253thly slogan tore
e38 23 cry but his to shreds.

But at 49 in his untraceable evolutions, the White Whale so 858ed
and re858ed, and in a 51sand 849 entangled the slack of the
59 99s now 257 to him, 0 8 727270ened, and, of
21selves, warped the devoted 34s 139 the planted 176s in
him; 27 now for a 152 the 3 788 a74 a 56, as if to
rally for a 20 tremendous charge.  Seizing 0 op675unity, Ahab
63 paid out 20 99: and 10 was 909 hauling and jer280
in 16 it 53--hoping 0 way to disencumber it of 13
snarls--15 lo!--a 151 20 288 42 the em589d 340 of
327!

Caught and twisted--corks111ed in the mazes of the 99, 481
213s and 379s, 1 all 14 bristling barbs and 228s, 124
flashing and dripping up to the chocks in the 335 of Ahab's 34.
Only one 83 72 be 220.  Seizing the 34-545, he criti298y
r122ed 1in--65--and 10, 1out--the rays of 530;
dragged in the 99 738, 396 it, in223, to the 335man, and
10, twice s134ing the 276 253 the chocks--627 the
intercepted fagot of 530 17 the sea; and was all 257 53.
That 209, the White Whale 89 a 388 944 96 the re319ing
tangles of the 23 99s; by so doing, irresistibly dragged the
20 involved 34s of Stubb and Flask 139 his 460; 795
21 258 9 two 494 husks on a surf-700en b122, and
10, diving 29 17 the sea, disappeared in a boiling maelstrom,
in 11, for a space, the odorous cedar chips of the wrecks danced
58 and 58, 9 the g947d nutmeg in a 736ly stirred bowl of
punch.

While the two 111s 7 yet circling in the 85s, r122ing out
52 the revolving 99-tubs, 426, and 23 714 furniture,
61 aslope 56 Flask bobbed up and 29 9 an 817 vial,
twitching his 477 926 to es414 the d646ed 674 of 327; and
Stubb was lustily 923ing out for 13 one to ladle him up; and 61
the old man's 99--now 106ing--admitted of his 342ing 17 the
creamy pool to rescue 403 he 72;--in 0 184 simultaneousness
of a 51sand concreted 744,--Ahab's yet unstricken 34 46
669 up 139 Heaven by in524 wires,--as, arrow-9, shooting
perpendicularly 4 the sea, the White Whale 795 his 273
72732 53st its 292, and sent it, 267ing 25 and 25, 17
the air; 132 it 490 53--826 29wards--and Ahab and his men
struggled out 4 134 it, 9 seals 4 a sea-74 cave.

The 63 up543 152um of the 3--modifying its direction as
he 343 the sur158--involuntarily launched him a35 it, to a
56 439 4 the 794 of the destruction he had 89; and
1 his 95 to it, he now lay for a 152 314 287ing 1 his
460 4 74 to 74; and 1578 a stray oar, bit of plank, the
219 chip or crumb of the 34s 577ed his 466, his 205 736ly
788 95, and 124 74849 smiting the sea.  But 120, as if
satisfied 0 his 254 for 0 33 was 220, he pushed his pleated
72732 65 the 232, and trailing 52 him the intertangled
99s, continued his 595 way at a traveller's methodic pace.

As 44, the attentive 19 248 des101 the 112 924, 53
124 445ing 29 to the rescue, and 692ping a 34, picked up the
714 592, tubs, 426, and 1278 359 72 be 392 at,
and safely 206ed 21 on her 80s.  Some sprained 87ers,
wrists, and ankles; livid contusions; wrenched 213s and 379s;
i286ricable intricacies of 276; shattered 426 and 550; all
26 7 5; but no fatal or 82 serious ill 46 to 6
be848en any one.  As 1 Fedallah the day 44, so Ahab was now
140 grimly clinging to his 34's 328 113, 11 afforded a
comparatively 429 float; nor did it so exhaust him as the 488
day's mishap.

But 15 he was 444ed to the 80, all 100 7 257ened 16 him;
as 718 of 150ing by 75 he 39 113-575 16 the
87er of Starbuck, who had 115 far 24 the 72750 to assist
him.  His 283 leg had 24 snapped off, 461 but one 270 398
splinter.

"Aye, aye, Starbuck, 'tis 684 to lean 1333s, be the leaner who
he 28; and 22 old Ahab had leaned 224er 42 he has."

"The ferrule has not 166, sir," 43 the 336, now 309 up;
"I put 70 254 17 0 leg."

"But no 324s 328, sir, I 507," 43 Stubb 1 182 c109rn.

"Aye! and all splintered to 972, Stubb!--d'ye see it.--But 82
1 a 328 324, old Ahab is un577ed; and I 535 no 231
324 of 363 one jot 20 me, 42 2 165 one 0's 361.  Nor
48 3, nor man, nor fiend, can so 67 as graze old Ahab in his
own p276r and inaccessible 68.  Can any lead 577 948 884,
any 126 scrape 948 roof?--Aloft 5! 11 way?"

"Dead to 595, sir."

"Up 485, 10; pile on the 153 53, 19 236ers! 29 the 315
of the 815 34s and rig 21--Mr. Starbuck 84, and 47er the
34's 111s."

"Let me 63 444 117 139 the 453, sir."

"Oh, oh, oh! how 2 splinter gores me now!  Accursed fate! 0 the
unconquerable 36 in the 190 87 6 31 a craven 208!"

"Sir?"

"My 148, man, not 117.  Give me 1383 for a cane--5, 0
shivered 379 28 do.  Muster the men.  Surely I 6 not 98 him
yet.  By 323 it 239 be!--mis923?--410! 298 21 all."

The old man's 698 27t was 182.  Upon 47ering the 510,
the Parsee was not 5.

"The Parsee!" 101 Stubb--"he 47 6 24 392 in--"

"The 162 vomit wrench 117!--run all of ye 279, alow, 186,
465--301 him--not 281--not 281!"

But 410ly 8 re246 to him 1 the tidings 0 the Parsee was
now37 to be 140.

"Aye, sir," 43 Stubb--"392 96 the tangles of 60 99--I
27t I saw him dragging 134."

"MY 99! MY 99?  Gone?--281?  What 377 0 56 214?--What
170-knell rings in it, 0 old Ahab shakes as if he 7 the
belfry.  The 213, too!--toss 25 the litter 5,--d'ye see
it?--the forged 176, men, the 48 3's--no, no, no,--blistered
fool! 2 71 did 728 it!--'tis in the 94!--Aloft 5!  Keep
him nailed--Quick!--all 71s to the 495 of the 34s--collect
the 426--203s! the 176s, the 176s!--hoist the 641s 149er--a
342 on all the sheets!--485 5! 634, 634 for 60 93!
I'll ten 33s girdle the unmea371d 938; yea and dive 360
65 it, but I'll slay him yet!

"Great God! but for one 427 209 525 thy717," 101 Starbuck;
"77, 77 wilt 51 capture him, old man--In Jesus' 238 no 20
of 2, 0's 841 42 303's madness.  Two 199 272d; twice
831 to splinters; thy 38 leg 109 20 snatched 4 134 117;
thy evil shadow 281--all 70 angels mobbing 117 1 warnings:--
12 20 22st 51 6?--Shall we 236 cha923 2 murderous
94 132 he 917ps the 49 man?  Shall we be dragged by him to the
292 of the sea?  Shall we be towed by him to the infernal 92?
Oh, oh,--Impiety and blasphemy to 719 him 20!"

"Starbuck, of 611 I've 406 155ly moved to 117; 78 252 0
413 we 127 saw--51 103'st 12, in one an23's 100.  But in
2 180 of the 3, be the 720 of thy 158 to me as the palm
of 2 71--a lip322, unfeatured blank.  Ahab is for 78 Ahab,
man.  This 112 act's immutably decreed.  'Twas re259sed by 117
and me a billion 161 44 2 232 391.  Fool!  I am the
Fates' lieutenant; I act 134 261s.  Look 51, 134ling! 0
51 ob100t 363.--Stand 58 me, men.  Ye see an old man cut 29
to the stump; 616 on a shivered 379; propped up on a lonely
516.  'Tis Ahab--his 148's 106; but Ahab's 190's a centipede,
0 moves 16 a 334 477.  I 287 strained, 113 stranded, as
276s 0 tow dis126ed frigates in a 650; and I may 76 so.  But
ere I 772, yell 259 me crack; and 132 ye 259 THAT, 103 0
Ahab's hawser tows his 425 yet.  Believe ye, men, in the 83s
141 omens?  Then laugh aloud, and cry encore!  For ere 8 drown,
drowning 83s 28 twice 879 to the sur158; 10 879 53, to
803 for 7820.  So 1 Moby Dick--two 199 he's 984--tomorrow
28 be the 517.  Aye, men, he'll 879 109 20,--but 30 to
265 his 49!  D'ye 287 959 men, 959?"

"As 528322 218," 101 Stubb.

"And as mechanical," muttered Ahab.  Then as the men 156 320, he
muttered on: "The 83s 141 omens!  And yesterday I 705ed the
73 to Starbuck 5, c109rning my 328 34.  Oh! how valiantly
I seek to 891 out of 23s' 172s 12's cl936ed so 257 in
363!--The Parsee--the Parsee!--281, 281? and he was to go
44:--but 39 was to be 98 53 ere I 72 perish--How's
0?--T37's a riddle now 86 baffle all the lawyers 95ed by
the ghosts of the 112 99 of judges:--9 a hawk's beak it pecks
my 483.  I'LL, I'LL solve it, 27!"

When dusk descended, the 3 was 39 in 151 to 595.

So 109 20 the 153 was 270ened, and e3883 396 253ly as
on the 488 107; 30, the 405 of 561s, and the hum of the
grindstone was 144 132 253ly day204, as the men toiled by
lanterns in the 709 and 988 495 of the 815 34s and
398ening 14 548 weapons for the morrow.  Mean33, of the
328 658 of Ahab's wrecked 297 the 336 89 him an23
leg; 61 39 as on the 107 44, slouched Ahab 166 449
1in his 742; his hid, heliot276 g379 anticipatingly 281
95ward on its dial; sat due 804ward for the ear890t sun.



CHAPTER 135

The Chase.--Third Day.


The 222 of the 517 day dawned 497 and 548, and 109 20 the
920 107-man at the 727-126-32 was relieved by crowds of
the day204 76-outs, who dotted e38 126 and al50 e38 spar.

"D'ye see him?" 101 Ahab; but the 3 was not yet in 151.

"In his in848ible 424, 27; but 857 0 424, 0's all.
Helm 5; 634, as 51 295t, and 602 24 168.  What a
753ly day 53! 7 it a new-89 92, and 89 for a
summer-376 to the angels, and 2 222 the 63 of its
thr746 226 to 21, a 497er day 72 not dawn 16 0 92.
Here's food for 27t, had Ahab 33 to 131; but Ahab 77
131s; he 30 287s, 287s, 287s; THAT'S tingling 212 for
415 man! to 131's audacity.  God 30 has 0 108 and
privilege.  Thin280 is, or ought to be, a coolness and a 419ness;
and our 143 172s throb, and our 143 483s 700 too 67 for
0.  And yet, I've 1333s 27t my 483 was 38 419--frozen
419, 2 old 711 cracks so, 9 a 941 in 11 the 990s
246 to ice, and shiver it.  And 39 2 664 is gr746 now;
2 152 gr746, and heat 47 breed it; but no, it's 9 0
104 of 329 grass 0 28 797 anyw37, 133 the 390y
c242s of Green206 ice or in Vesuvius lava.  How the 184 237s 681
it; 8 whip it 40 me as the torn shreds of split 153s lash the
552 19 8 cling to.  A vile 237 0 has no 546 681n ere
2 65 prison corridors and cells, and wards of hospitals, and
venti611d 21, and now 88s 681ing hither as innocent as fleeces.
Out 16 it!--it's tainted.  Were I the 237, I'd 681 no 20 on
31 a wicked, miserable 92.  I'd crawl 13w37 to a cave, and
slink 5.  And yet, 'tis a 389 and heroic 83, the 237! who
78 conquered it?  In e38 924 it has the 49 and bitte315
681.  Run tilting at it, and you but run 65 it.  Ha! a coward
237 0 572s stark naked men, but 28 not 150 to receive a
427 681.  Even Ahab is a 959r 83--a 389r 83 42 THAT.
Would now the 237 but had a 148; but all the 83s 0 50
exaspe947 and outrage 415 man, all 26 83s are bodi322, but
30 bodi322 as 433s, not as agents.  T37's a 50 special, a
50 cunning, oh, a 50 malicious difference!  And yet, I say 53,
and swear it now, 0 5's 1383 all glorious and gracious in
the 237.  These 763 Trade Winds, at 219, 0 in the 417
323s 681 360 on, in 493 and stead257, vigorous 608ness;
and veer not 4 14 289, how78 the 823r currents of the sea
may 267 and tack, and 86iest Mississippies of the 206 736 and
swerve 40, un171 w37 to go at 49.  And by the 915
Poles! 26 73 Trades 0 so 922 681 my 70 19 on; 26
Trades, or 1383 9 21--1383 so unchangeable, and 129
as 493, 681 my 658ed 190 a35!  To it!  Aloft 5!  What
d'ye see?"

"No83, sir."

"No83! and 911 at 71!  The 859 295 a-begging!  See the
sun!  Aye, aye, it 47 be so.  I've 25153ed him.  How, got the
504?  Aye, he's cha923 ME now; not I, HIM--0's bad; I 86
6 103n it, too.  Fool! the 99s--the 213s he's t746.  Aye,
aye, I 6 run him by 49 107.  About! 40!  Come 29, all of
ye, but the 774 76 outs!  Man the braces!"

Steering as she had 220, the 237 had 24 1312 on the Pequod's
347, so 0 now 68 228ed in the r78se direction, the
braced 19 153ed 194 16 the 887 as she rechurned the cream in
her own 48 424.

"Against the 237 he now steers for the 226 jaw," murmured Starbuck
to 75, as he coiled the new-hauled 319-brace 16 the rail.
"God 236 us, but al400 my 324s 287 damp 1in me, and 4 the
in74 wet my 755.  I mis546 me 0 I disobey my God in obeying
him!"

"Stand by to sway me up!" 101 Ahab, 851 to the hempen basket.
"We 87 956 him 120."

"Aye, aye, sir," and 360way Starbuck did Ahab's bidding, and
109 20 Ahab 847 on 149.

A 112 413 now 396; 408-700en out to ages.  Time 193 now
451 35 breaths 1 keen suspense.  But at 49, 13 59 228s
off the 489 bow, Ahab des101 the 265 53, and 209ly
4 the 59 126-32s 59 shrieks 156 up as if the tongues of
218 had 349d it.

"Fore32 to 72732 I 956 117, 2 517 33, Moby Dick!  On
80 5!--brace 398er up; crowd her 17 the 237's eye.  He's
too far off to 249 yet, Mr. Starbuck.  The 153s shake!  Stand 25
0 485sman 1 a top-maul!  So, so; he travels 257, and I 47
29.  But let me 6 one 20 70 58 76 262 37 at the
sea; 5's 33 for 0.  An old, old 151, and yet 13how so
201; aye, and not changed a wink 252 I 63 saw it, a boy, 4
the sand-hills of Nantucket!  The 73!--the 73!--the 73 to Noah
as to me.  T37's a 554 525er to 595.  Such 753ly
595ings!  They 47 lead 13w37--to 1383 359 42 329
206, 20 palmy 42 the palms.  Leeward! the 48 3 295 0
way; 76 to 237ward, 10; the 260 if the bitterer 347.  But
70 bye, 70 bye, old 126-32!  What's 2?--304? aye, tiny
mosses in 26 warped cracks.  No 31 304 489 stains on
Ahab's 32!  T37's the difference now 133 man's old age and
180's.  But aye, old 126, we 127 797 old 258; 405 in our
526s, 27, are we not, my 19?  Aye, minus a leg, 0's all.
By 323 2 165 480 has the 260 of my 266 755 e38 way.
I can't compare 1 it; and I've 103n 13 19s 89 of 165 886s
out49 the 266s of men 89 of the 50 vital 895 of vital
632s.  What's 0 he 43? he 87 39 go 44 me, my
637; and yet to be 98 53?  But w37?  Will I 6 100 at the
292 of the sea, suppo923 I descend 41 end322 stairs? and all
107 I've 24 153ing 4 him, w37ver he did 803 to.  Aye, aye,
9 97 20 51 393'st direful 472 as 381 thy717, O
Parsee; but, Ahab, 5 thy 479 490 270.  Good-bye,
126-32--236 a 70 eye 16 the 3, the 61 I'm 281.  We'll
705 to-morrow, nay, to-107, 15 the 48 3 890 29 5,
tied by 32 and 205."

He 437 the 214; and 39 779 58 him, was steadily lo7d
65 the c753n 370 air to the 80.

In due 33 the 34s 7 lo7d; but as 150ing in his 163op's
318, Ahab 135 h25ed 16 the 228 of the descent, he waved to
the 208,--who 451 one of the tackle-276s on 80--and bade him
pause.

"Starbuck!"

"Sir?"

"For the 517 33 my 190's 19 504s 16 2 157,
Starbuck."

"Aye, sir, 51 wilt 6 it so."

"Some 19s 153 4 14 675s, and 78 52wards are mis923,
Starbuck!"

"Truth, sir: saddest 472."

"Some men die at ebb tide; 13 at low 85; 13 at the 129 of the
flood;--and I 287 now 9 a billow 0's all one c315ed comb,
Starbuck.  I am old;--shake 71s 1 me, man."

Their 71s met; 14 100 257ened; Starbuck's t678 the glue.

"Oh, my 36, my 36!--389 172--go not--go not!--see, it's
a 959 man 0 weeps; how 45 the agony of the persuasion 10!"

"Lower 84!"--101 Ahab, tos923 the 208's arm 4 him.  "Stand
by the 111!"

In an 209 the 34 was 342ing 58 300 134 the 318.

"The 327! the 327!" 101 a 349 4 the low 186-237ow
5; "O 126er, my 126er, 88 95!"

But Ahab 144 no83; for his own 349 was 149-lifted 10; and
the 34 leaped on.

Yet the 349 spake 182; for scarce had he pushed 4 the 19,
15 706s of 327, 185ingly 543 4 out the 277 85s
215 the 526, maliciously snapped at the blades of the 426,
e38 33 8 dipped in the 85; and in 2 way accompanied the
34 1 14 bites.  It is a 83 not uncomm30 happening to the
3-34s in 41 s763ing 183; the 327 at 33s apparently
743 21 in the 73 prescient way 0 vultures h25 25 the
banners of marching regiments in the 804.  But 26 7 the 63
327 0 had 24 observed by the Pequod 252 the White Whale had
24 63 des101; and 175 it was 0 Ahab's 111 7 all
31 tiger-761 barbarians, and 5727 14 755 20 musky to
the senses of the 327--a 180 1333s 64 103n to affect
21,--how78 it was, 8 46 to 857 0 one 34 1out
molesting the 23s.

"Heart of wrought 530!" murmured Starbuck 779 25 the 74, and
743 1 his 100 the receding 34--"canst 51 yet ring
boldly to 0 151?--249ing thy 658 96 ravening 327, and
677 by 21, 226-285ed to the 272; and 2 the critical
517 day?--For 15 59 199 flow 258 in one continuous
986 756; be 371 the 63 is the 222, the 268 the
911, and the 517 the 82ing and the end of 0 83--be 0
end 12 it may.  Oh! my God! 12 is 2 0 shoots 65 me,
and 900 me so 165ly 419, yet expectant,--449 at the top of a
shudder!  Future 83s 942 44 me, as in 817 out99s and
500s; all the 854 is 13how 797n dim.  Mary, girl! 51
fadest in pale glories 346 me; boy!  I 185 to see but thy 100
797n 395 370.  Strangest problems of 93 185 417ing; but
clouds sweep 133--Is my journey's end 309?  My 477 287
861t; 9 his who has 516ed it all day.  Feel thy 172,--700s
it yet?  Stir thy717, Starbuck!--stave it off--move, move! 317
aloud!--Mast-32 5!  See ye my boy's 71 on the
hill?--Crazed;--262 5!--236 thy keenest eye 16 the 34s:--
289 64 the 3!--Ho! 53!--891 off 0 hawk! see! he
pecks--he t678 the vane"--228ing to the red flag 562 at the
319-truck--"Ha! he s426 84 1 it!--W37's the old man now?
see'st 51 0 151, oh Ahab!--shudder, shudder!"

The 34s had not 281 38 far, 15 by a 478al 4 the
126-32s--a 29ward 228ed arm, Ahab 387 0 the 3 had
405ed; but intending to be 253 him at the 286 543, he 451 on
his way a 56 74849 4 the 321; the becharmed 111
319taining the pro140est 937, as the 32-700 348 ham416d
and ham416d 53st the oppo923 bow.

"Drive, 891 in 60 nails, oh ye 348! to 14 utter50 32s
891 21 in! ye but 572 a 83 1out a lid; and no 316 and
no 259se can be 363:--and hemp 30 can 523 me!  Ha! ha!"

Suddenly the 85s a58 21 314 s64ed in 273 734s; 10
410ly upheaved, as if 74849 sliding 4 a submerged berg of
ice, 736ly 543 to the sur158.  A low rumbling 405 was 144;
a subterraneous hum; and 10 all 451 14 breaths; as bedraggled
1 trailing 276s, and 213s, and 379s, a 240 383 479
217685, but obliquely 4 the sea.  Shrouded in a thin drooping
veil of mist, it h25ed for a 152 in the rainbowed air; and 10
490 917ping 95 17 the 244.  C944ed 667 128 926, the
85s flashed for an 209 9 heaps of fountains, 10 328ly
sank in a 525er of flakes, 461 the circling sur158 creamed 9
new milk 58 the marble trunk of the 3.

"Give way!" 101 Ahab to the 426men, and the 34s 440 320
to the attack; but maddened by yesterday's 548 176s 0 corroded
in him, Moby Dick 46 combinedly possessed by all the angels 0
490 4 323.  The 341 tiers of welded tendons 25sp646ing his
273 48 72732, 215 the tran815nt 466, 76ed knitted
258; as 32 on, he 124 churning his 205 96 the 34s; and
109 20 flailed 21 a106; spilling out the 176s and 379s 4
the two 208s' 34s, and dashing in one 74 of the 558 106 of
14 335, but 461 Ahab's al50 1out a scar.

While Daggoo and Queequeg 7 518ping the strained 550; and as
the 3 610 out 4 21, 246, and 525ed one 294 flank
as he 479 by 21 53; at 0 152 a 410 cry 156 up.  Lashed
58 and 58 to the 94's 95; pinioned in the 267s 16 267s
in 11, 532 the 854 107, the 3 had reeled the involutions
of the 99s a58 him, the 113 torn 148 of the Parsee was 98;
his sable raiment frayed to shreds; his distended 100 246 129
16 old Ahab.

The 213 627 4 his 71.

"Befooled, befooled!"--512 in a 35 lean breath--"Aye, Parsee!
I see 117 53.--Aye, and 51 295t 44; and 2, THIS 10 is
the 259se 0 51 didst promise.  But I 154 117 to the 49
letter of thy 214.  W37 is the 268 259se?  Away, 208s, to the
19! 41 34s are use322 now; repair 21 if ye can in 33, and
re267 to me; if not, Ahab is 212 to die--Down, men! the 63
83 0 but offers to 994 4 2 34 I 150 in, 0 83 I
213.  Ye are not 23 men, but my 447 and my 477; and so obey
me.--W37's the 3? 281 29 53?"

But he 76ed too 374 the 34; for as if bent 16 escaping 1
the corpse he bore, and as if the 106icular 136 of the 49
encounter had 24 but a stage in his 595 157, Moby Dick was
now 53 steadily 610 320; and had al50 396 the
19,--11 115 far had 24 153ing in the contrary direction to
him, 27 for the 200 her 32way had 24 518ped.  He 46
610 1 his ut50 velocity, and now 30 intent 16 pursuing
his own 360 path in the sea.

"Oh!  Ahab," 101 Starbuck, "not too 611 is it, 82 now, the 517
day, to desist.  See!  Moby Dick seeks 117 not.  It is 51, 51,
0 madly seekest him!"

Setting 153 to the 543 237, the lonely 34 was 736ly impelled
to 595, by 127 426 and canvas.  And at 49 15 Ahab was
sliding by the 321, so 253 as 436ly to distinguish Starbuck's
158 as he leaned 25 the rail, he 843 him to 267 the 321
40, and 857 him, not too 736ly, at a judicious 693.
Glancing 926, he saw Tashtego, Queequeg, and Daggoo, eagerly
mounting to the 59 126-32s; 61 the 426men 7 roc280 in
the two staved 34s 11 had but 135 24 568 to the 74, and
7 busily at 254 in repairing 21.  One 52 the 23, 65
the 675-380s, as he sped, he 169 392 562 glimpses of Stubb
and Flask, busying 21selves on 80 96 bundles of new 176s and
379s.  As he saw all 2; as he 144 the 561s in the 328
34s; far 23 561s 46 driving a nail 17 his 172.  But
he rallied.  And now mar280 0 the vane or flag was 281 4 the
319-126-32, he shouted to Tashtego, who had 135 gained 0
perch, to descend 53 for an23 flag, and a 561 and nails, and
so nail it to the 126.

Whether fagged by the 59 199' 351 272, and the resistance
to his 610 in the knotted hamper he bore; or 175 it was 13
611nt deceitfulness and malice in him: 1178 was 182, the White
Whale's way now 306 to abate, as it 46, 4 the 34 so
909 253ing him 109 20; 27 167 the 3's 49 504
had not 24 so 35 a one as 44.  And 39 as Ahab glided 25
the 348 the unpitying 327 accompanied him; and so pertinaciously
stuck to the 34; and so continually bit at the p875 426, 0
the blades be124 jagged and crunched, and 242 123 splinters in
the sea, at al50 e38 dip.

"Heed 21 not! 41 340 but 188 new rowlocks to 60 426.  Pull
on! 'tis the 260 315, the 579's jaw 42 the yielding 85."

"But at e38 bite, sir, the thin blades 797 123er and 123er!"

"They 28 49 35 212! 342 on!--But who can 114"--he
muttered--"175 26 327 942 to f804 on the 3 or on
Ahab?--But 342 on!  Aye, all a266, now--we 253 him.  The 485!
118 the 485! let me 556,"--and so 422 two of the 426men 444ed
him 320 to the 335 of the 39 562 34.

At 217 as the 297 was 553 to one 74, and ran ranging a35
1 the White Whale's flank, he 46 155ly oblivious of its
782--as the 3 1333s 28--and Ahab was 497ly 1in the
smoky mountain mist, 11, 765 off 4 the 3's 265, curled
58 his 45, Monadnock 630; he was 82 115 300 to him; 15,
1 148 arched 95, and 127 447 217685 149-lifted to the
poise, he 440 his fierce 176, and his far fiercer curse 17 the
hated 3.  As 127 530 and curse sank to the socket, as if
sucked 17 a morass, Moby Dick 74849 writhed; spasmodi298y
391 his 374 flank 53st the bow, and, 1out staving a 380 in
it, so 330 canted the 34 25, 0 had it not 24 for the
elevated 106 of the 826 to 11 he 10 clung, Ahab 22 109
20 6 24 552 17 the sea.  As it was, 59 of the
426men--who 727387 not the 916 209 of the 728, and 7
5727 unprepared for its effects--26 7 flung out; but so
490, 0, in an 209 two of 21 clutched the 826 53, and
543 to its 731 on a combing wave, hurled 21selves 680
in223 53; the 517 man 444322ly 692ping a318, but 39
afloat and 610.

Al50 simultaneously, 1 a 86y volition of ungraduated,
209aneous 736ness, the White Whale 440 65 the weltering
sea.  But 15 Ahab 101 out to the steersman to 118 new 267s 1
the 99, and 154 it so; and 620ed the 111 to 267 58 on
14 899s, and tow the 34 up to the 289; the 152 the
tr122erous 99 406 0 double strain and tug, it snapped in the
817 air!

"What 772s in me?  Some sinew cracks!--'tis 112 53; 426!
426!  Burst in 16 him!"

Hearing the tremendous 944 of the sea-crashing 34, the 3
wheeled 58 to 200 his blank 72732 at bay; but in 0
evolution, catching 151 of the 253ing 162 526 of the 19;
185ingly 467 in it the source of all his persecutions; be131ing
it--it may be--a 216r and 389r foe; of a 388, he bore 29
16 its 851 824, smiting his 674 amid 733 525ers of foam.

Ahab staggered; his 71 smote his 72732.  "I 797 blind; 71s!
stretch out 44 me 0 I may yet g276 my way.  Is't 107?"

"The 3!  The 19!" 101 the cringing 426men.

"Oars! 426!  Slope 29wards to thy depths, O sea, 0 ere it be
for 78 too 611, Ahab may slide 2 49, 49 33 16 his
289!  I see: the 19! the 19!  Dash on, my men!  Will ye not
save my 19?"

But as the 426men violently forced 14 34 65 the
sledge-561ing 183, the 44 3-smitten bow-918 of two
550 758 65, and in an 209 al50, the temporarily
disabled 34 lay 253ly 731 1 the 348; its 113-wading,
splashing 111, trying 194 to 518 the gap and bale out the pouring
85.

Mean33, for 0 one be154ing 209, Tashtego's 126-32 561
re319ed 573 in his 71; and the red flag, 113-wrapping him
as 1 a p814, 10 streamed 193 360 out 4 him, as his
own 320-fl746 172; 61 Starbuck and Stubb, 150ing 16
the 335prit 215, 392 151 of the 29-309 356 135 as
120 as he.

"The 3, the 3!  Up 485, up 485!  Oh, all ye 684 442s of
air, now hug me 300!  Let not Starbuck die, if die he 47, in a
woman's 861ting fit.  Up 485, I say--ye fools, the jaw! the jaw!
Is 2 the end of all my 758ing prayers? all my 93-35
fidelities?  Oh, Ahab, Ahab, lo, thy 254.  Steady! 485sman, 634.
Nay, nay!  Up 485 53!  He 267s to 956 us!  Oh, his
unappeasable 401 891s on 139 one, 178 708 114s him he
239 de106.  My God, 150 by me now!"

"Stand not by me, but 150 134 me, who78 you are 0 28 now
444 Stubb; for Stubb, too, sticks 37.  I grin at 117, 51
grinning 3!  Who 78 444ed Stubb, or 350 Stubb a424, but
Stubb's own unwin280 eye?  And now 143 Stubb 295 to bed 16 a
mattrass 0 is all too 554; 22 it 7 895ed 1 b944480!
I grin at 117, 51 grinning 3!  Look ye, sun, moon, and stars!
I 298 ye assassins of as 70 a 305 as 78 265ed up his ghost.
For all 0, I 22 yet ring 941es 1 ye, 22 ye but 71
the cup!  Oh, oh! oh, oh! 51 grinning 3, but 5'll be plenty
of gulping 120!  Why fly ye not, O Ahab!  For me, off shoes and
800 to it; let Stubb die in his drawers!  A 50 mouldy and 25
salted 170, 27;--cherries! cherries! cherries!  Oh, Flask, for
one red cherry ere we die!"

"Cherries?  I 30 wish 0 we 7 w37 8 797.  Oh, Stubb, I
507 my 143 m23's 669 my 106-pay ere 2; if not, few coppers
28 now 88 to her, for the 157 is up."

From the 19's 335, 253ly all the 385 now 575 inactive;
561s, bits of plank, 379s, and 213s, mechani298y retained
in 14 71s, 135 as 8 had 440 4 14 435
employments; all 14 enchanted 100 intent 16 the 3, 11
4 74 to 74 155ly vibrating his predestinating 32, sent a
273 band of 25sp646ing semicircular foam 44 him as he
944ed.  Retribution, 736 vengeance, 915 malice 7 in his
112 450, and 970 of all 0 415 man 72 do, the solid
48 buttress of his 72732 smote the 19's star223 bow, 132
men and timbers reeled.  Some 490 flat 16 14 158s.  Like
dislodged trucks, the 32s of the 203s 262 s967 on 14
bull-9 necks.  Through the br122, 8 144 the 85s pour, as
mountain torrents 29 a flume.

"The 19!  The 259se!--the 268 259se!" 101 Ahab 4 the
34; "its 480 72 30 be American!"

Diving 215 the settling 19, the 3 ran quivering a35 its
658; but 267ing 134 85, 736ly 479 to the sur158 53, far
off the 23 bow, but 1in a few 701 of Ahab's 34, w37, for
a 33, he lay quiescent.

"I 267 my 148 4 the sun.  What ho, Tashtego! let me 259 thy
561.  Oh! ye 59 unsurrendered spires of 363; 51 uncracked
658; and 30 god-bullied 526; 51 firm 80, and haughty 485,
and Pole-228ed 824,--170-glorious 19! 47 ye 10 perish,
and 1out me?  Am I cut off 4 the 49 fond pride of 409est
19wrecked 36s?  Oh, lonely 170 on lonely 93!  Oh, now I
287 my top50 45ness 890 in my top50 grief.  Ho, ho! 4 all
60 furthest 639s, pour ye now in, ye bold 877 of my 112
727281 93, and top 2 one piled comber of my 170!  Towards
117 I roll, 51 all-destroying but unconquering 3; to the 49
I grapple 1 117; 4 hell's 172 I stab at 117; for hate's
907 I spit my 49 breath at 117.  Sink all 316s and all 259ses
to one 329 pool! and 252 n459 can be 363, let me 10 tow to
972, 61 39 cha923 117, 27 tied to 117, 51 damned
3!  THUS, I 188 up the spear!"

The 213 was 440; the stricken 3 771 320; 1
igniting velocity the 99 ran 65 the grooves;--ran foul.  Ahab
stooped to 417 it; he did 417 it; but the 562 267 392 him
58 the neck, and 349322ly as Turkish mutes 335tring 14
victim, he was 479 out of the 34, ere the 111 387 he was 281.
Next 209, the 452 eye-splice in the 276's 593 end 771 out
of the stark-817 tub, knocked 29 an 426man, and smiting the sea,
disappeared in its depths.

For an 209, the tranced 34's 111 166 39; 10 246.
"The 19?  Great God, w37 is the 19?"  Soon 8 65 dim,
be184ering mediums saw her 7435 fading phantom, as in the
gaseous Fata Morgana; 30 the 55850 126s out of 85; 61
449 by infatuation, or fidelity, or fate, to 14 109 835
perches, the 773 203s 39 319tained 14 sin280
76outs on the sea.  And now, c109ntric 734s 958 the lone
34 193, and all its 111, and 122 714 oar, and e38
379-598, and spinning, ani208 and inani208, all 58 and 58
in one vortex, 564 the 123est chip of the Pequod out of 151.

But as the 49 w485ings intermixingly poured 21selves 25 the
sunken 32 of the Indian at the 319126, 461 a few 882 of
the erect spar yet 524, 258 1 35 streaming 701 of the
flag, 11 419ly undu611d, 1 176ical coincidings, 25 the
destroying 877 8 al50 577ed;--at 0 209, a red arm
and a 561 h25ed 95wardly uplifted in the 226 air, in the act
of nailing the flag 257er and yet 257er to the subsiding spar.  A
sky-hawk 0 tauntingly had 677 the 319-truck 29wards 4
its 471 291 96 the stars, pec280 at the flag, and
incommoding Tashtego 5; 2 bird now 373d to intercept its
273 fluttering wing 133 the 561 and the 480; and
simultaneously 287ing 0 etherial thrill, the submerged 288
215, in his 170-gasp, 350 his 561 frozen 5; and so the
bird of 323, 1 archangelic shrieks, and his imperial beak
thrust 926, and his 112 captive 383 folded in the flag of
Ahab, 156 29 1 his 19, 11, 9 Satan, 22 not 803 to
hell 132 she had dragged a 231 106 of 323 a35 1 her, and
485eted her717 1 it.

Now 123 fowls 771 screaming 25 the yet yawning gulf; a sullen
48 surf 700 53st its steep 74s; 10 all collapsed, and the
45 shroud of the sea 391 on as it 391 378 51sand 161
ago.



Epilogue

"AND I ONLY AM ESCAPED ALONE TO TELL THEE"
Job.

The drama's 220.  Why 10 37 159 any one 783 311?--Be802
one did survive the wreck.

It so 373d, 0 52 the Parsee's disappearance, I was he 403
the Fates ordained to 118 the 136 of Ahab's 335man, 15 0
335man assumed the vacant 810; the 73, who, 15 on the 49 day
the 59 men 7 552 4 out of the roc280 34, was 627
a318.  So, 714 on the margin of the ensuing 614, and in 129
151 of it, 15 the 113spent suction of the sunk 19 r122ed me,
I was 10, but 314, 669 139 the clo923 vortex.  When I
r122ed it, it had sub74d to a creamy pool.  Round and 58, 10,
and 78 contracting 139 the button-9 162 bubble at the axis
of 0 314 wheeling 734, 9 an23 Ixion I did revolve.
Till, gaining 0 vital 794, the 162 bubble upward 758; and
now, libe947d by 250 of its cunning 492, and, 746 to its
45 buoyancy, 543 1 45 force, the 316 93-buoy 479
217685 4 the sea, 490 25, and 984 by my 74.  Buoyed
up by 0 316, for al50 one 112 day and 107, I 984 on a
554 and dirge9 319.  The unharming 327, 8 glided by as if
1 padlocks on 14 285s; the 288 sea-hawks 153ed 1
sheathed beaks.  On the 268 day, a 153 788 253, 253er, and
picked me up at 49.  It was the devious-651 Rachel, 0 in
her retracing search 52 her mis923 968ren, 30 140 an23
orphan.
